Save such discussions for office hours with the course staff.</li>\n<li>Conceptual questions may be shared publicly but exercise sound judgment.</li>\n<li>If you are confident in your knowledge, it is acceptable to provide answers to your fellow students' questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Philosophy</span></h3>\n<p>System programming concerns the development of software and services used by applications and operating systems, e.g., OS functions, defragmenter, web servers, databases, search tools, backup systems, etc. This course will provide the information and experience required to understand, design, and implement components of large and small software systems.</p>\n<p>In general, students successfully completing the course will be able to evaluate design alternatives according to engineering best practices, specifications, performance analysis, robustness, etc. This course will investigate one system and one programming language in detail through demonstrations, programs, programming assignments, etc. The specific system is Unix, a family of operating systems forming a complete standardized programming environment based on the idea of software tools. The specific language is C, which is widely used for operating system implementations, and which forms the basis for the C++ and Java languages studied in the prerequisite courses. This will help students understand operating system services available to application programmers, and provide a firm ground for the study of operating systems in general.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This course covers the basic skills and topics that form the foundation of later CMPSC and CMPEN courses. For this reason, it is essential that every student attend and learn the material. It will be nearly impossible for students to complete later courses in these majors without mastery of this material.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Grading</span></h3>\n<p>The course will be graded on exams and course projects:</p>\n<table id=\"rounded-corner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 49.4402%; height: 530px;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 34px;\">Activity</th>\n<th style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 34px;\">Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 28px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 28px;\">Course Projects</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 28px;\">50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #1</p>\n<p>Date: 17th February</p>\n<p>Time: 8:10 PM to 10:00 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Location:&nbsp;</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #2</p>\n<p>Date: 31st March</p>\n<p>Time: <span>&nbsp;8:10 PM - 10:00 PM</span></p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 52px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 52px;\">Final Exam (time/date TBD)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 52px;\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the exams to pass the class.</li>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the class projects to pass the class.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Exam Policy: Make-Up and Conflict Exam</span></h3>\n<strong data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\"></strong>Please note the following policy regarding exams for this course:</div>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<div>Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>There will be only one conflict/Makeup exam.<br>A conflict/Make-up exam will be offered only to students with a verified scheduling conflict and health issue.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>To be eligible, students must provide appropriate documentation as proof of the conflict and other reasons.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Penalties for Missing the Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>If you cannot attend the conflict/Make-Up exam, and request another conflict/Make-Up exam,&nbsp;<br>you will get a 25% penalty on points.

Note that any publication of the assignments (e.g., via github or other system) is considered a violation of the above policy.</p>\n<p>More information on The Department of Computer Science and Engineering\u2019s Academic Integrity Standards, which are applicable to this course, can be found at<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx</a></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Lateness Policy</span></h3>\n<p>Lab assignments are assessed a 10% per day late penalty, up to a maximum of three days after which a zero grade will be given. No exceptions. Period. &nbsp;Note that the last lab will not have a three-day grace period as we need to finish the grading of this lab as soon as possible and make time for the grading of the final exam.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Virtual Machines/Student Computer</span></h3>\n<p>As part of the course projects, every student will be required to maintain a virtual machine on a personal computer. Students are responsible for administrating and maintaining these virtual machines and are strongly encouraged to back them up frequently.</p>\n<p>It is the student's responsibility to have a functioning and suitably powerful computer to run their virtual machines.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Hardware or software failures are the student's responsibility, and can not be used as an excuse for late assignments</strong></span>. The minimum requirements for this computer that has 100MB of free storage, 8GB of memory, and a 64-bit processor. Netbooks and tablets are not suitable.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Prerequisites</span></h3>\n<p>You must have completed and passed (with a grade of C or better) the prerequisite course CMPSC 221, Object-Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications, which uses Java. You must have completed and passed (C or better) the earlier courses CMPSC 131 and 132. If, instead, you have completed and passed similar courses elsewhere, contact the instructor. Prior experience with Unix or C is not expected, but you should be very familiar with the concepts introduced in CMPSC 131 and 132 and know how to use an integrated development environment, e.g., Microsoft's Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>If possible, you should take CMPEN 331, Computer Organization and Design, at the same time as this course, or within one semester of it. The connection between these courses would be stronger if we could require you to take both at the same time, but that's not possible. In 331, you learn about the basics of memory organization (registers, cache, main memory, virtual memory), instruction execution, exceptions and interrupts, and the translation of procedural programming languages into machine instructions.</p>\n<p>This is a three-credit course, and you can expect to spend a lot of time outside of class working on the project programming. To avoid turning the programming assignments into a nightmare of unsuccessful debugging, you should recognize symptoms of confusion early and promptly ask for help from the professors or TA. With the exception of first and second assignments, the following assignments will build on previous assignments, so incomplete or poor code will make later assignments very difficult if not impossible. For this reason, it is essential students do not get behind on the projects.</p>\n<p>We will often give you some code as examples or as a starter kit for an assignment, and the use of that material is encouraged. After that point, the programming work should be done on your own.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>This will be strictly enforced.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Ethics</span></h3>\n<p>This course considers topics involving systems. As part of this investigation, we will cover technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for any purpose or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class.</p>\n<p>Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating on tests, or other disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics and will result in the penalty identified above. Programming assignments must be completed without assistance or cooperation between students.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries with it similar penalties.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, please contact the course professor for advice. Do not undertake any action which could be perceived as technology misuse or cheating anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received explicit permission from Professor Suman Saha.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Disability Accommodation</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University\u2019s educational programs.

The more specific purpose is to provide students a basic understanding of the role of financial and managerial accounting information in the decisions of capital market participants external to a business enterprise (e.g., stockholders, banks, financial analysts, prospective stockholders), and in the decisions of those who manage business enterprises. Accounting information has an important role in the resource allocation process in our socioeconomic system as a whole, as well as in each individual business enterprise. This course provides students with an understanding of the nature of the accounting function, and how the information in accounting reports is used by various decision-makers in their resource allocation decisions. This course is an important background course for all business majors and numerous non-business majors.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #394b58; background: #394b58; padding: 0 1rem;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #fff; font-variant: small-caps;\"><strong> <img src=\"https://eldig.psu.edu/storyline/images/syl-faculty1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">Instructional Team</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div class=\"grid-row\" style=\"grid-gap: 5%; margin: 0; width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/kms563-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Kristy Schenck</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:kms563@psu.edu\">kms563@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/snh108-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Schalyn Sohn</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:snh108@psu.edu\">snh108@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img id=\"171435605\" src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682060/preview?verifier=YnFLamBH4JkZRJMKb86TtByip00tdgpqJ3WFKVCe\" alt=\"Curling.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682060\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Shelley Curling<br><a href=\"mailto:mlh257@psu.edu\">mlh257@psu.edu</a><br></strong></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682017/preview?verifier=FOXaFg0SSXguF2o2M0jFXC6ueLoELgEffGHPZYA0\" alt=\"instructor photo\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682017\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Course Coordinator:</span><br>Karen Trust<br></strong><a href=\"mailto:kjb322@psu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kjb322@psu.edu</a>&nbsp;<br>Karen manages the TAs.

We will use a Freeware simulator called MARS to support the required assembly language programming. This software is available for download from the following link <a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">MARS</a> \"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\", MARS itself has a nice Help feature. \u201c<a href=\"http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/\">http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/</a>\u201d.</li>\n<li>For the Verilog language, you will need to use Xilinx Vivado/ModelSim. This is available in w136 Westgate building. You can also download Vivado (<strong>It is available for windows machine and it is not available for Mac</strong>). Instructions for downloading the Vivado WebPack version can be found here: \u201c <a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html\">https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html</a><span>\u201d</span><span>.</span> Xilinx has a strict internal export control policy which blocks users from E or D category countries. Check this file for more details: <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file\">https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file</a>.</li>\n<li>Students are facing different issues while installing Vivado. So, I request everyone to complete the installation as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>It is very recommended to install Vivado as all the labs hints are using this software. However, students facing the Vivado license issue should install an alternative software called \"Intel Quartus\".</li>\n<li>This is very uncommon but just to let you know that <strong>students who are outside the United States may face difficulties with respect to Vivado webpack installation due to license issues.</strong> <strong>They can install the Intel Quartus software instead</strong>. This problem occurred due to obligations of export controls and related license agreement restrictions for Vivado. In this case, students are not allowed to use any such controlled software even remotely if they are in a location forbidden by said agreements.

However, you have the permission to miss one of the homework without penalty</u></strong>. You have to solve the online problems in the zyBooks website (https://www.zybooks.com). Some of the problems will be assigned in advance of covering their corresponding materials in class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Exams</u></em></p>\n<p>There will be <strong>three</strong> midterm exams. Each student is entitled to skip one exam due to official reasons without incurring any penalties. Consequently, no makeup exam will be granted for the first missed exam. You will only be eligible for a particular makeup exam if you have missed two or more exams due to official excuses. Please be aware that if you choose to miss one exam for personal reasons, it will count towards your official number of allowable excuses mentioned earlier. It is strongly recommended not to miss any exams unless you have an official excuse. Official excuses need to be approved by the instructor in advance. Please refer to the 'Guidelines for Makeup Examinations' for further information. <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup exam unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy.</strong></p>\n<p><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></p>\n<p><em><u>Quizzes</u></em></p>\n<p>6 \u2013 9 pre-announced quizzes will be given during the semester, (<strong>no makeups,</strong> unless you have more than a defined number of official excuses), <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup quiz unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy</strong>.&nbsp; Every student will have a defined number, in advance, of excuses to use them for skipping any defined number of quizzes if needed (these can be personal or official excuses). Meaning that, I will <strong>drop</strong> the lowest defined number of scores. This defined number is currently equal to two and it could increase in the future. You must take a permission <strong>in advance</strong> from the instructor if you would like to take your quiz with another section. Cheating on any QUIZ will result in 0 grade on that QUIZ.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Labs</u></em></p>\n<p>Lab assignments will be assigned on canvas. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 2% per day, up to a maximum of 5 days (with one minute being equivalent to one day). It is advisable to adhere to timely submission and refrain from relying on the available late submission days. Your proactive approach to meeting deadlines is highly encouraged. No submission will be accepted after the 5<sup>th</sup> day of the due date. TAs or LAs (if any) will grade the submitted zipped file to canvas. Please expect that we might pick randomly some students to grade their submitted labs through one to one meeting with the grader. In this case, your answers have to match your submission and you need to show your understanding of your solution. Your GRADE will depend solely on your answers to the grader(s) questions in that particular lab. The same apply for the project stated in the next item.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em><u>Project</u></em></p>\n<p><strong>There will be one project. This project due date will be posted online, late submission will not be accepted.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Guidelines for Makeup Examinations or Delayed Assignment Submission:</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>- A self-report or standard doctor's appointment is not considered an acceptable reason or suffice as an excuse.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Evidence from an in-person visit with a healthcare practitioner, explicitly demonstrating the inability to partake in the exam/quiz as originally scheduled, is necessary.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- It must be emphasized that under these circumstances too, notifications regarding excuses have to be delivered at least 24 hours before the designated assignment due date. This is crucial as late submission requests beyond the assignment deadline or approved grace period will not be accommodated.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>-An email petition sent by a student on the day of or one day prior to the exam requesting a makeup examination does not ensure automatic acceptance by the instructor. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Unexcused absence from an examination without prior consent of the instructor will disqualify students from being allowed a makeup opportunity regardless of their situation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING:</strong></p>\n<p>Homework: 5%</p>\n<p>Labs: 20%</p>\n<p>Quizzes: 25%</p>\n<p>Exam 1: 15% (Tentative: Week of February 24<sup>th </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 2: 15% (Tentative: Week of March 31<sup>st</sup> in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 3: 15% (Tentative: Week of April 21<sup>st </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Project: 5 %</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING DISTRIBUTION: </strong></p>\n<p>A&nbsp; 100-94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+&nbsp; &lt; 90 - 86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C+&nbsp; &lt; 77 - 73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; &lt; 68 - 61</p>\n<p>A-&nbsp; &lt;94- 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 86 - 81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 73 - 68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 61 - 0</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 81-77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Engaging in academic dishonesty during any examination will result in a grade of 0 for that specific examination. <strong>Violations will be subject to academic integrity consequences, which may include failure of the course in certain instances.

Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Penn State policy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>, an academic integrity violation is \u201can intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.\u201d&nbsp;Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use&nbsp;ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not&nbsp;submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content.&nbsp;Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor&nbsp;<strong>before submitting work</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course</strong>&nbsp;unless they are cleared of wrongdoing&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean\u2019s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Appropriate behavior expectations </strong></p>\n<p><span>Sexual misconduct is never tolerated at Penn State. Prohibited conduct includes sexual and gender-based harassment, stalking, sexual assault, and dating violence. These behaviors are not allowed in the classroom, the campus community, labs, or anywhere students, staff, and faculty are located. Prohibited behaviors can include degrading comments such as belittling female-identified students, LGBTQ+ individuals, and gender-diverse students. It can also include harassment, touching someone without their consent, following someone without consent, repeated calls or messaging, physical acts of violence, and more. In other words, professional and appropriate behavior is always expected, and inappropriate or unprofessional behavior is never tolerated.

Two sections are scheduled in the afternoons on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>\n<p>All three examinations must be taken within the physical classroom setting, and no online alternatives will be provided.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Communication</span></h3>\n<p><span>General messages will be disseminated through Canvas Announcements. For queries that need to be answered elsewhere, it is advised to contact the Teaching Assistant (TA) initially. If the TA cannot address your question, you may direct your inquiry to the instructor or have your TA relay the question to the instructor.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>We will utilize <span>Campuswire</span> as the platform for class discussions. To participate, kindly sign up and join <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://campuswire.com/p/G23B3167B\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Campuswire</span></a> using the group code 2607. <em><strong>Students are strongly encouraged to register using their .psu email ID</strong></em>. It is important to exercise discretion and refrain from posing questions that may reveal crucial aspects of assignments. Additionally, please exhibit courtesy, and before posting, check previous threads to ascertain if your question has already been addressed. The following rules apply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are welcome to pose questions related to lectures or assignments.</li>\n<li>Refrain from sharing your code, program output, or any solutions. Save such discussions for office hours with the course staff.</li>\n<li>Conceptual questions may be shared publicly but exercise sound judgment.</li>\n<li>If you are confident in your knowledge, it is acceptable to provide answers to your fellow students' questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Philosophy</span></h3>\n<p>System programming concerns the development of software and services used by applications and operating systems, e.g., OS functions, defragmenter, web servers, databases, search tools, backup systems, etc. This course will provide the information and experience required to understand, design, and implement components of large and small software systems.</p>\n<p>In general, students successfully completing the course will be able to evaluate design alternatives according to engineering best practices, specifications, performance analysis, robustness, etc. This course will investigate one system and one programming language in detail through demonstrations, programs, programming assignments, etc. The specific system is Unix, a family of operating systems forming a complete standardized programming environment based on the idea of software tools. The specific language is C, which is widely used for operating system implementations, and which forms the basis for the C++ and Java languages studied in the prerequisite courses. This will help students understand operating system services available to application programmers, and provide a firm ground for the study of operating systems in general.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This course covers the basic skills and topics that form the foundation of later CMPSC and CMPEN courses. For this reason, it is essential that every student attend and learn the material. It will be nearly impossible for students to complete later courses in these majors without mastery of this material.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Grading</span></h3>\n<p>The course will be graded on exams and course projects:</p>\n<table id=\"rounded-corner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 49.4402%; height: 530px;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 34px;\">Activity</th>\n<th style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 34px;\">Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 28px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 28px;\">Course Projects</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 28px;\">50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #1</p>\n<p>Date: 17th February</p>\n<p>Time: 8:10 PM to 10:00 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Location:&nbsp;</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #2</p>\n<p>Date: 31st March</p>\n<p>Time: <span>&nbsp;8:10 PM - 10:00 PM</span></p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 52px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 52px;\">Final Exam (time/date TBD)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 52px;\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the exams to pass the class.</li>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the class projects to pass the class.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Exam Policy: Make-Up and Conflict Exam</span></h3>\n<strong data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\"></strong>Please note the following policy regarding exams for this course:</div>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<div>Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>There will be only one conflict/Makeup exam.<br>A conflict/Make-up exam will be offered only to students with a verified scheduling conflict and health issue.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>To be eligible, students must provide appropriate documentation as proof of the conflict and other reasons.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Penalties for Missing the Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>If you cannot attend the conflict/Make-Up exam, and request another conflict/Make-Up exam,&nbsp;<br>you will get a 25% penalty on points.

Any violation of this policy will be considered cheating and will result in the student receiving an 'F' grade for the project and a full letter grade off the final grade for the course. Students with more than one violation may face stronger penalties per the university policy.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Students are forbidden from copying code, makefiles, or any other material from the Internet (such as publicly available Github repos). Plagiarism will be strictly enforced by the TAs through in-depth reviews of your submissions.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Any violation in the letter or spirit of this policy will also be considered cheating and handled as described above. Note that any publication of the assignments (e.g., via github or other system) is considered a violation of the above policy.</p>\n<p>More information on The Department of Computer Science and Engineering\u2019s Academic Integrity Standards, which are applicable to this course, can be found at<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx</a></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Lateness Policy</span></h3>\n<p>Lab assignments are assessed a 10% per day late penalty, up to a maximum of three days after which a zero grade will be given. No exceptions. Period. &nbsp;Note that the last lab will not have a three-day grace period as we need to finish the grading of this lab as soon as possible and make time for the grading of the final exam.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Virtual Machines/Student Computer</span></h3>\n<p>As part of the course projects, every student will be required to maintain a virtual machine on a personal computer. Students are responsible for administrating and maintaining these virtual machines and are strongly encouraged to back them up frequently.</p>\n<p>It is the student's responsibility to have a functioning and suitably powerful computer to run their virtual machines.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Hardware or software failures are the student's responsibility, and can not be used as an excuse for late assignments</strong></span>. The minimum requirements for this computer that has 100MB of free storage, 8GB of memory, and a 64-bit processor. Netbooks and tablets are not suitable.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Prerequisites</span></h3>\n<p>You must have completed and passed (with a grade of C or better) the prerequisite course CMPSC 221, Object-Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications, which uses Java. You must have completed and passed (C or better) the earlier courses CMPSC 131 and 132. If, instead, you have completed and passed similar courses elsewhere, contact the instructor. Prior experience with Unix or C is not expected, but you should be very familiar with the concepts introduced in CMPSC 131 and 132 and know how to use an integrated development environment, e.g., Microsoft's Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>If possible, you should take CMPEN 331, Computer Organization and Design, at the same time as this course, or within one semester of it. The connection between these courses would be stronger if we could require you to take both at the same time, but that's not possible. In 331, you learn about the basics of memory organization (registers, cache, main memory, virtual memory), instruction execution, exceptions and interrupts, and the translation of procedural programming languages into machine instructions.</p>\n<p>This is a three-credit course, and you can expect to spend a lot of time outside of class working on the project programming. To avoid turning the programming assignments into a nightmare of unsuccessful debugging, you should recognize symptoms of confusion early and promptly ask for help from the professors or TA. With the exception of first and second assignments, the following assignments will build on previous assignments, so incomplete or poor code will make later assignments very difficult if not impossible. For this reason, it is essential students do not get behind on the projects.</p>\n<p>We will often give you some code as examples or as a starter kit for an assignment, and the use of that material is encouraged. After that point, the programming work should be done on your own.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>This will be strictly enforced.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Ethics</span></h3>\n<p>This course considers topics involving systems. As part of this investigation, we will cover technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for any purpose or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class.</p>\n<p>Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating on tests, or other disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics and will result in the penalty identified above. Programming assignments must be completed without assistance or cooperation between students.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries with it similar penalties.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, please contact the course professor for advice. Do not undertake any action which could be perceived as technology misuse or cheating anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received explicit permission from Professor Suman Saha.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Disability Accommodation</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University\u2019s educational programs.

The more specific purpose is to provide students a basic understanding of the role of financial and managerial accounting information in the decisions of capital market participants external to a business enterprise (e.g., stockholders, banks, financial analysts, prospective stockholders), and in the decisions of those who manage business enterprises. Accounting information has an important role in the resource allocation process in our socioeconomic system as a whole, as well as in each individual business enterprise. This course provides students with an understanding of the nature of the accounting function, and how the information in accounting reports is used by various decision-makers in their resource allocation decisions. This course is an important background course for all business majors and numerous non-business majors.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #394b58; background: #394b58; padding: 0 1rem;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #fff; font-variant: small-caps;\"><strong> <img src=\"https://eldig.psu.edu/storyline/images/syl-faculty1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">Instructional Team</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div class=\"grid-row\" style=\"grid-gap: 5%; margin: 0; width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/kms563-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Kristy Schenck</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:kms563@psu.edu\">kms563@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/snh108-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Schalyn Sohn</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:snh108@psu.edu\">snh108@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img id=\"171435605\" src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682060/preview?verifier=YnFLamBH4JkZRJMKb86TtByip00tdgpqJ3WFKVCe\" alt=\"Curling.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682060\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Shelley Curling<br><a href=\"mailto:mlh257@psu.edu\">mlh257@psu.edu</a><br></strong></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682017/preview?verifier=FOXaFg0SSXguF2o2M0jFXC6ueLoELgEffGHPZYA0\" alt=\"instructor photo\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682017\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Course Coordinator:</span><br>Karen Trust<br></strong><a href=\"mailto:kjb322@psu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kjb322@psu.edu</a>&nbsp;<br>Karen manages the TAs.

We will use a Freeware simulator called MARS to support the required assembly language programming. This software is available for download from the following link <a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">MARS</a> \"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\", MARS itself has a nice Help feature. \u201c<a href=\"http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/\">http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/</a>\u201d.</li>\n<li>For the Verilog language, you will need to use Xilinx Vivado/ModelSim. This is available in w136 Westgate building. You can also download Vivado (<strong>It is available for windows machine and it is not available for Mac</strong>). Instructions for downloading the Vivado WebPack version can be found here: \u201c <a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html\">https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html</a><span>\u201d</span><span>.</span> Xilinx has a strict internal export control policy which blocks users from E or D category countries. Check this file for more details: <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file\">https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file</a>.</li>\n<li>Students are facing different issues while installing Vivado. So, I request everyone to complete the installation as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>It is very recommended to install Vivado as all the labs hints are using this software. However, students facing the Vivado license issue should install an alternative software called \"Intel Quartus\".</li>\n<li>This is very uncommon but just to let you know that <strong>students who are outside the United States may face difficulties with respect to Vivado webpack installation due to license issues.</strong> <strong>They can install the Intel Quartus software instead</strong>. This problem occurred due to obligations of export controls and related license agreement restrictions for Vivado. In this case, students are not allowed to use any such controlled software even remotely if they are in a location forbidden by said agreements. Accordingly, you are not permitted to use Vivado even if you have the access to log in remotely to w135 in Westgate building or any other lab that you have access to here in the United States.</li>\n<li>Follow the following steps to install Quartus software:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to this website: https://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite.</li>\n<li>Select Edition: Lite Select Release: 19.1</li>\n<li>Go to combined files tab =&gt; Download .tar file</li>\n<li>Extract the downloaded .tar file</li>\n<li>Then, run \"QuartusLiteSetup\" file which should automatically install all other files.</li>\n<li>If it asks for user sign in, then just create an account using college mail id and use it to sign in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE REMOTE LOGIN TO W135 WESTGATE BUILDING:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The hostnames are e5-cse-135-01.cse.psu.edu through e5-cse-135-38.cse.psu.edu and can be accessed remotely once connected to the PSU Globalprotect vpn.&nbsp; The Windows machines are not accessible remotely but are available at w136 Westgate.</p>\n<p>Students need to connect to GlobalProtect vpn and then ssh to one of the w135 Linux machines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>COURSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Critical thinking, problem solving and information literacy: Students will use critical thinking and problem solving skills in analyzing information gathered through different media and from a variety of sources.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;By the end of the semester, successful student will be expected to Identify/Recognize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Logic Circuits and how data is represented</li>\n<li>Computer organization</li>\n<li>Assembler directives and the Instruction set</li>\n<li>How to write small programs in assembly language and translate them to machine code</li>\n<li>Combine basic digital circuitry components to process subsets of machine code</li>\n<li>MIPS and data path with pipeline implementation</li>\n<li>Verilog test bench and familiarity with Zynq 7000 Development Board</li>\n<li>Memory Hierarchy</li>\n<li>Storage and I/O devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>REQUIRED WORK </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Homework</u></em></p>\n<p>Problems will be assigned weekly or biweekly. <strong><u>Late homework will not receive any credit. However, you have the permission to miss one of the homework without penalty</u></strong>. You have to solve the online problems in the zyBooks website (https://www.zybooks.com). Some of the problems will be assigned in advance of covering their corresponding materials in class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Exams</u></em></p>\n<p>There will be <strong>three</strong> midterm exams. Each student is entitled to skip one exam due to official reasons without incurring any penalties. Consequently, no makeup exam will be granted for the first missed exam. You will only be eligible for a particular makeup exam if you have missed two or more exams due to official excuses. Please be aware that if you choose to miss one exam for personal reasons, it will count towards your official number of allowable excuses mentioned earlier. It is strongly recommended not to miss any exams unless you have an official excuse. Official excuses need to be approved by the instructor in advance. Please refer to the 'Guidelines for Makeup Examinations' for further information. <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup exam unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy.</strong></p>\n<p><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></p>\n<p><em><u>Quizzes</u></em></p>\n<p>6 \u2013 9 pre-announced quizzes will be given during the semester, (<strong>no makeups,</strong> unless you have more than a defined number of official excuses), <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup quiz unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy</strong>.&nbsp; Every student will have a defined number, in advance, of excuses to use them for skipping any defined number of quizzes if needed (these can be personal or official excuses). Meaning that, I will <strong>drop</strong> the lowest defined number of scores. This defined number is currently equal to two and it could increase in the future. You must take a permission <strong>in advance</strong> from the instructor if you would like to take your quiz with another section. Cheating on any QUIZ will result in 0 grade on that QUIZ.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Labs</u></em></p>\n<p>Lab assignments will be assigned on canvas. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 2% per day, up to a maximum of 5 days (with one minute being equivalent to one day). It is advisable to adhere to timely submission and refrain from relying on the available late submission days. Your proactive approach to meeting deadlines is highly encouraged. No submission will be accepted after the 5<sup>th</sup> day of the due date. TAs or LAs (if any) will grade the submitted zipped file to canvas. Please expect that we might pick randomly some students to grade their submitted labs through one to one meeting with the grader. In this case, your answers have to match your submission and you need to show your understanding of your solution. Your GRADE will depend solely on your answers to the grader(s) questions in that particular lab.

This is crucial as late submission requests beyond the assignment deadline or approved grace period will not be accommodated.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>-An email petition sent by a student on the day of or one day prior to the exam requesting a makeup examination does not ensure automatic acceptance by the instructor. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Unexcused absence from an examination without prior consent of the instructor will disqualify students from being allowed a makeup opportunity regardless of their situation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING:</strong></p>\n<p>Homework: 5%</p>\n<p>Labs: 20%</p>\n<p>Quizzes: 25%</p>\n<p>Exam 1: 15% (Tentative: Week of February 24<sup>th </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 2: 15% (Tentative: Week of March 31<sup>st</sup> in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 3: 15% (Tentative: Week of April 21<sup>st </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Project: 5 %</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING DISTRIBUTION: </strong></p>\n<p>A&nbsp; 100-94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+&nbsp; &lt; 90 - 86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C+&nbsp; &lt; 77 - 73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; &lt; 68 - 61</p>\n<p>A-&nbsp; &lt;94- 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 86 - 81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 73 - 68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 61 - 0</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 81-77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Engaging in academic dishonesty during any examination will result in a grade of 0 for that specific examination. <strong>Violations will be subject to academic integrity consequences, which may include failure of the course in certain instances.

Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Penn State policy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>, an academic integrity violation is \u201can intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.\u201d&nbsp;Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use&nbsp;ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not&nbsp;submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content.&nbsp;Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor&nbsp;<strong>before submitting work</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course</strong>&nbsp;unless they are cleared of wrongdoing&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean\u2019s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Appropriate behavior expectations </strong></p>\n<p><span>Sexual misconduct is never tolerated at Penn State. Prohibited conduct includes sexual and gender-based harassment, stalking, sexual assault, and dating violence. These behaviors are not allowed in the classroom, the campus community, labs, or anywhere students, staff, and faculty are located. Prohibited behaviors can include degrading comments such as belittling female-identified students, LGBTQ+ individuals, and gender-diverse students. It can also include harassment, touching someone without their consent, following someone without consent, repeated calls or messaging, physical acts of violence, and more. In other words, professional and appropriate behavior is always expected, and inappropriate or unprofessional behavior is never tolerated.

The deadline is 28th February. However, this lab has a checkpoint, whose deadline is Feb 23. There will be a 50% penalty for missing the checkpoint submission. You do not need to submit anything in Canvas for the checkpoint because we will download the last version in GitHub as your checkpoint version. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lab 2 is a critical part of this course, serving as the foundation for all future labs. Unlike Lab 1, which was a warm-up to C, Lab 2 is the main building block for Labs 3, 4, and 5.

Just like you learn and practice other tools that you\u2019ll use in the real world (programming languages, test equipment, simulation software, etc.), practicing integrity in an academic setting will help you make ethical decisions once you\u2019re in the workforce. Practice makes perfect!</p>\n<p>All engineers and scientists need to follow codes of ethics. Here are a few examples of professional codes of ethics in related fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Code of Ethics</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics\" target=\"_blank\">ACM Code of Ethics</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics\" target=\"_blank\">NSPE Code of Ethics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the consequences of violating academic integrity standards can be steep, the consequences of ethics violations in the workplace can be even more detrimental, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being terminated from a job</li>\n<li>fines being levied onto individuals and/or companies</li>\n<li>legal action</li>\n<li>injury/death to users of products that were jeopardized by unethical practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many examples of lapses in ethical judgment in industry that led to lawsuits, injuries, or even death.

However, if one does not have a thorough understanding of the code/library they use, this could pose security problems. The code may contain errors or even intentional malicious backdoor traps. For example, here are <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://nightfall.ai/resources/accidental-data-leaks/\" target=\"_blank\">five common accidental sources of data leaks</a>. You must be able to properly scrutinize, vet, or modify the code you find through other resources. If you haven't properly learned the material, you could be opening yourself, and others, to harm.</p>\n<p>In an academic setting, the goal of projects/assessments is to learn. Looking up answers, or even submitting modified code/work from others after understanding what it does is not a good way to learn or a sustainable practice. Instructors may utilize existing resources as good, or bad, examples to help you learn, but you must develop a strong foundation to build on, so you are able to be competitive and innovative once you enter the workforce.</p>\n<div class=\"content-box\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n<div class=\"grid-row center-xs\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.05rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"What is Academic Integrity (AI)?\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/pages/what-is-academic-integrity-ai\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/pages/what-is-academic-integrity-ai\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">What is Academic Integrity?</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"Why AI is Important\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/pages/why-is-academic-integrity-important\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/pages/why-is-academic-integrity-important\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Why is AI Important?</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"Types of AI Violations\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/pages/types-of-ai-violations\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/pages/types-of-ai-violations\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Types of AI Violations</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"Consequences of an AI Violation\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/pages/consequences-of-an-ai-violation\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/pages/consequences-of-an-ai-violation\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Consequences of AI Violations</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"AI Violation Process\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/pages/academic-integrity-violation-process\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/pages/academic-integrity-violation-process\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">AI Violation Process</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"EECS AI Quiz\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/quizzes/5243852?module_item_id=43860218\" data-api-endpoint=\"$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/quizzes/g577c7dc38efe739f891455033c7287de?module_item_id=gc01226dc9fd78266f98472c8e4dca929\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Take the Quiz</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple instances of operating systems to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources. This process is called virtualization, and the operating system instances are called virtual machines (VMs)\u2014software emulations of physical computers.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), such as VirtualBox manages these VMs as they run alongside each other. It separates VMs from each other logically, assigning each slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage. This prevents the VMs from interfering with each other; so if, for example, one OS suffers a crash or a security compromise, the others survive.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/files/170417469/preview?verifier=uEquzeUMf0kqyb7cUlULdrq4CMdgVx2BjosN5sbc\" alt=\"Screenshot (365).png\" width=\"226\" height=\"27\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/files/170417469\" data-api-returntype=\"File\" loading=\"lazy\"></span></p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/files/170417470/preview?verifier=yJ7BM7B8WZXVVQ43jhLrgqzTVpCO5dKJU7EPy0kj\" alt=\"Screenshot (366).png\" width=\"708\" height=\"155\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/files/170417470\" data-api-returntype=\"File\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There are two broad categories of hypervisors: Type 1 and Type 2.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/files/170417471/preview?verifier=9LnBckWVvM4Xn9MfoaPZzMZXRZvfMJAbrZYT79gu\" alt=\"Screenshot (362).png\" width=\"368\" height=\"188\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2379517/files/170417471\" data-api-returntype=\"File\" loading=\"lazy\"></em></span></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><em>Type 1 hypervisor</em></span></h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the underlying computer\u2019s physical hardware, interacting directly with its CPU, memory, and physical storage.

It allows many users to share a powerful machine and all the available resources, each user running their own processes simultaneously. </span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><em>Multi-tasking:</em> This proper multi-tasking aspect of UNIX allows far greater flexibility than is possible with other operating systems; even more, recent multi-tasking versions of popular PC operating systems. &nbsp;The advantages of a truly flexible multi-tasking operating system has been demonstrated with the popularity of UNIX in the scientific, engineering and financial communities, along with the rise of Linux and OS-X.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"><em>Portability:</em> It is the ability of a piece of software to move easily from one hardware platform to another.

While a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds started developing Linux to create a system similar to MINIX, a UNIX operating system. In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the operating system's core, was released in 1994. At about the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and the FSF (Free Software Foundation) tried creating an open-source UNIX-like operating system called GNU. In contrast to Torvalds, Stallman, and the FSF, they started by creating utilities such as gcc, gdb, bash, and emacs for the operating system first. These utilities were then added to the Linux kernel to create a complete system called GNU/Linux, or, less precisely, just Linux.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Linux, an Operating System, or a Kernel</strong></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Linux, in its nature, is not an operating system; it\u2019s a Kernel.

For it to be an OS, it is supplied with GNU software and other additions giving us GNU/Linux.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The latter is then installed on a computer as a distribution such as Ubuntu, elementary OS, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc. However, because there are Linux distributions paired with more software other than GNU, some people feel we cannot generalize all \u2018</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Linux-Kerneled</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u2018 operating systems as GNU/Linux.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Linux can be viewed as software layers</strong></p>\n<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">OS Kernel</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">&nbsp;is the central component of an operating system that manages the operations of a computer and hardware. It handles operations of memory and CPU time. It is a core component of an operating system.

It is a programmatic method in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the OS.

To understand the concept, you should think of \"free\" as in \"free speech,\" not as in \"free beer\".

      "content": "<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Git</span></strong></h4>\n<p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on these files among multiple users. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear work-flows</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Signing Up</span></strong></h4>\n<p>To use GitHub, you first need to create an account. To do that, go to https://github.com, click on the Sign-Up button, and proceed to the registration&nbsp;form. Choose a proper username and remember your login credentials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NOTE: If you already have a Github account, you can use that. However, you cannot change your Github username throughout the semester.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>Installing git on Computer</strong></span></h4>\n<p>If you don't have git on your local machine, it will show an error message \"<em>unknown command</em>\" when you try the git command on your terminal. To install git on your local machine, follow the command:</p>\n<p>$ sudo apt install git</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>Configuring the git</strong></span></h4>\n<p>To configure your git client in the terminal (either your VM or your Linux/WSL machine), set your name and email using the following commands:</p>\n<p>$ git config --global user.name \u201cYour Name\u201d</p>\n<p>$ git config --global user.email &nbsp;\u201dYour Email\u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>Adding SSH key</strong></span></h4>\n<p>To authenticate your Git client while working with your repository, add your public SSH key to your GitHub account. To do so, follow the below steps: <br><br></p>\n<p>i. Create an SSH key by running this command on your terminal:</p>\n<p>$ ssh\u2212keygen \u2212t rsa \u2212b 4096 \u2212C \u201dyour@email.com\u201d</p>\n<p>ii. Press Enter on any question to select the default answer.</p>\n<p>iii. Your public SSH key will be created in $ \u223c/.ssh/id rsa.pub. Copy its content. To copy, you can run the $cat \u223c/.ssh/id rsa.pub command and copy from terminal</p>\n<p>iv. Go to your GitHub account, click on your profile in the top right, and click on settings.</p>\n<p>v. In the left-side menu, select SSH and GPG keys.</p>\n<p>vi. Click on New SSH Key, set a proper name for the key (e.g., 311VMKey), paste your public Key, and click on Add SSH Key.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Accepting the assignment</span></strong></h4>\n<p>Once the assignment is released, you will receive an invitation link to join a corresponding private repository. By accepting the invitation,&nbsp; you will have access to your private repository containing the starter files we provide. Your private repository is accessible at https://github.com/PSU-CMPSC311-SAHA/&lt;assignmentName&gt;-&lt;YourGithubUsername&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>Initialize a local directory as a Git repository.</strong></span></h4>\n<p>You want to clone the assignment from the GitHub repository to your local machine. Thus, you can update them on the local machine and then push them to the GitHub account. Therefore, create a local directory and initialize the directory as a git repository using the following command:</p>\n<p>$ mkdir assignments</p>\n<p>$ cd assignments</p>\n<p>$ git init</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>Cloning The Assignment Repository</strong></span></h4>\n<p>To clone your assignment repository to your local machine, run the following command on your terminal:</p>\n<p>$ git clone https://github.com/PSU-CMPSC311-SAHA/&lt;assignmentName&gt;-&lt;githubUserName&gt;.git</p>\n<p>This command will download the repository to your current working directory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Pushing Changes</span></strong></p>\n<p>Whenever you change an existing file or add a new file to your local repository, you must commit the changes and then push them to the remote repository on gitHub.com.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><em>Add files that have been created or have been changed:</em></span></p>\n<p>$&nbsp; &nbsp;git&nbsp; &nbsp;add &nbsp;&lt;list of filenames separated by space&gt;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Commit the changes with a message about that change:</span></em></p>\n<p>$&nbsp; &nbsp;git commit -m \u201d your&nbsp; &nbsp;proper &nbsp;commit&nbsp; &nbsp;message \u201d</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><em>Finally, push the changes to the remote repository:</em></span></p>\n<p>$ &nbsp;git push origin main</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Other Commands</span></strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>git init: initialize an existing directory as a Git repository</li>\n<li>git clone [url]: retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL</li>\n<li>git status: show modified files in the working directory, stage for your next commit</li>\n<li>git add [file]: add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)</li>\n<li>git reset [file]: unstage a file while retaining the changes in the working directory</li>\n<li>git diff: diff of what is changed but not staged</li>\n<li>git diff \u2013staged: diff of what is staged but not yet committed</li>\n<li>git commit -m \u201c[descriptive message]\u201d: commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot</li>\n<li>git branch: list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch</li>\n<li>git branch [branch-name]: create a new branch at the current commit</li>\n<li>git checkout: switch to another branch and check it out in your working directory</li>\n<li>git merge [branch]: merge the specified branch\u2019s history into the current one</li>\n<li>git log: show all commits in the current branch\u2019s history</li>\n<li>git log branchB..branchA : show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB</li>\n<li>git log --follow [file]: show the commits that changed file, even across renames</li>\n<li>git diff branchB...branchA : show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB</li>\n<li>git show [SHA]: show any object in Git in human-readable format</li>\n<li>git rm [file]: delete the file from the project and stage the removal for commit</li>\n<li>git mv [existing-path] [new-path]: change an existing file path and stage the move</li>\n<li>git log --stat -M: show all commit logs with an indication of any paths that moved</li>\n<li>git remote add [alias] [url]: add a git URL as an alias</li>\n<li>git fetch [alias]: fetch down all the branches from that Git remote</li>\n<li>git merge [alias]/[branch]: merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date</li>\n<li>git push [alias] [branch]: Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch</li>\n<li>git pull: fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch</li>\n<li>git rebase [branch]: apply any commits of the current branch ahead of the specified one</li>\n<li>git reset --hard [commit]: clear staging area, rewrite working tree from the specified commit</li>\n<li>git stash: Save modified and staged changes</li>\n<li>git stash list: list stack-order of stashed file changes</li>\n<li>git stash pop: write working from the top of the stash stack</li>\n<li>git stash drop: discard the changes from the top of the stash stack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong>Important Note</strong></span></h4>\n<p>Do not push your assignment in one shot!

Practically speaking, lectures and course assignments will provide students with experience programming in C within the UNIX environment. UNIX tools will be introduced, as will the general UNIX philosophy. Fluency in the use of the command line will be encouraged and expected, as will canonical compiler tools such as GCC. We will examine the use of shell programs, compilers, build sequences, memory management, filesystems, signal processing, parallel programming, and other topics essential to computer scientists. In addition, we will introduce students to the basics of systems administration on UNIX virtual machines.</p>\n<p>See the <a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Syllabus\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2379517/assignments/syllabus\" target=\"_blank\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2086230/pages/course-syllabus\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">syllabus</a> for more information on the course.

This gives you the chance to make changes to the climate system, such as increasing the solar input, and see what the effect will be on the temperature of the earth.</p>\n<p>Climate models are very powerful tools which we can use to understand the relationships between different forcings, however, they are also very complicated as they include a lot of physics. We don't expect you to memorize or understand all of the equations, they are there so that people who want to can dig deeper. We really just want you to get an idea of what goes into a climate model and how we can use it to better understand the climate system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The model you are using is called STELLA and it has a very intuitive web interface.&nbsp; I highly recommend you use Chrome as your browser if at all possible.&nbsp; There are detailed instructions and a practice so you get to answer the same type of questions you will see in the for credit lab.</p>\n<p>As I said in my announcement, I recommend you get going on the lab early this week, that will help you understand material in the quiz.</p>\n<p><strong>This week the lab closes on Wednesday night, Wednesday February 12.</strong></p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

That is your job.&nbsp; Find posts that interest you<u> </u>and comment on them. My main role is to make sure the forum is courteous and supportive.<br></strong></p>\n<p>The grading system in Yellowdig is built in.&nbsp; You\u2019ll get points for posting and replying once you pass the minimum length limits and you\u2019ll get points when other students comment on your post.&nbsp; <strong>So the best way to succeed is to post Early and comment Often!&nbsp; The goal is NOT to leave working on your weekly entry till 11PM on Saturday night!&nbsp;</strong> You won\u2019t be able to get the maximum number of points for that week that way.&nbsp; Post on Monday or Tuesday and you will.</p>\n<p>One thing about Yellowdig.&nbsp; <strong>I cannot get into the system to give extensions or change points awarded.&nbsp; If you miss a deadline for any reason there is nothing I can do.</strong>&nbsp; One thing that Yellowdig does have is a buffer of 35% meaning you can exceed the 1000 points required to get an A by 350 points, so you can make up credit lost in past weeks by excelling in the current week.&nbsp; That is the only way to make up for absence or inactivity.</p>\n<p>So I encourage you to build your community in this class.&nbsp; You might make friends, you certainly will see the passion other students have for important and urgent issues facing our Earth.</p>\n<p>Have fun with Yellowdig!</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

One such past climate was the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a time about 56 million years ago when the climate warmed rapidly. Scientists believe that studying the PETM may give us insight into current warming trends. Therefore for Module 1 Lab this week you will compare estimated ocean temperature data from the PETM with modern sea surface temperatures. The lab relies on Google Earth; if you have not already, be sure to complete the Google Earth Tutorial.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Please begin with the Practice lab (Module 1 lab 1 Submission (Practice)), it has the same type of questions you will get in the graded lab for credit. &nbsp;You can get the instructions and the key Google Earth kmz files on the Instruction page.&nbsp; <strong>Make sure you listen to my video on how to open files and do other important steps.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Once you have completed the practice, you may submit answers in Canvas. The practice lab has no time limit and unlimited attempts. It's an excellent way to verify whether or not you understand the concepts of the lab.</p><p>When you are ready, proceed to the Module 1 lab 1 Submission (Graded).&nbsp; You will have one 90-minute attempt with no retakes so that\u2019s why its good to do the practice as many times till you are ready.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Tim</p></div></div></div></div><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

You earn more points for a great initial entry. Your peers are your judges and when they respond to your post because it interests or resonates with them, you get points. So you will be rewarded for doing great research and generating an excellent and thoughtful original post. Feel free to add images and videos to bring your post to life, but these are not essential. The main thing is that a quality post based on solid research will get you credit. Also, early entries will get more points because more students will get to respond to them before the deadline, so do not wait until the deadline to post your initial entry.</p>\n<p>I will monitor the feed and award accolades and extra points for excellent entries. This will be another good way for you to see what a good entry looks like. I can also deduct points for entries that are off subject, have errors, or are impolite or offensive. Use of AI is easily detected and will result in severe penalties.</p>\n<p>You get credit for replying to posts. <strong>Replies must be 25 words long to get credit.</strong> Please avoid single line entries like \u201cI agree with you.\u201d Make sure your entry has substance.</p>\n<p>Here is a summary of the scoring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Writing an Initial Post of at least <strong>75</strong> words (<strong><i>280 </i></strong>points) as early as possible.<br></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Writing a Comment of at least <strong>25</strong> words (<strong>210</strong> points) by Saturday midnight.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving a Comment on your Post (<strong>70 </strong>points)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving an Accolade on your Post or Comment (Points vary):</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving a Reaction on your Post or Comment (<strong>50</strong> points</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line, you need to get 1000 points a week to get full credit in Yellowdig</strong>.&nbsp; You will learn how the scoring works as you post. Watch your score in Yellowdig and learn what you need to do to get 1000 points a week. Scores transfer to Canvas daily so you can watch there too but Yellowdig is more current.&nbsp; <strong>The score in Canvas is an average for the number of weeks so do not worry when the score drops on Sunday morning, it will rise again when you start posting.</strong></p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

The goal is to take what you have learned in the module and synthesize it with your own research and analysis.&nbsp; You will be required to submit an original entry every week and to reply to at least one other student's post by Saturday midnight.&nbsp; Submit your entry early to get more responses and more points. Your grade will be based on how active you are in the conversation.&nbsp; Yellowdig is used for the discussion as it offers a much better experience than traditional Canvas discussion boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The first topics will open on Sunday related to Module 1.</strong></p>\n<p>The Capstone Discussion is a great way to gain credit lost in the quizzes and labs if you spend the time to be engaged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also have an \"I need help\" option in Yellowdig for you to get help with labs or other matters. Include @ProfessorBralower for a faster response.</p>\n<p>Please read he instructions in the Orientation and Module 1 carefully.&nbsp; You will need to make an account with a one-time payment of $12.95 for the semester. You can purchase online or at the bookstore.&nbsp; You will get the hang of the discussion in the first week and get an idea of how your activity is rewarded in points.&nbsp; The main advice I have is to post your initial entry early.&nbsp; That way it will gain more attention and possibly more points.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that Use of AI of ChatGPT in generating entries is a breach of Academic integrity and is easily detected.&nbsp; The penalties will be severe, so please make sure you always write everything in your own words</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "content": "<p>Hi, Students:</p>\n<p>I\u2019m writing to welcome you to Earth 103, Earth in the Future. I\u2019m Tim Bralower, Professor for the class and I look forward to a great semester.</p>\n<p>The goal of the course is to understand how Earth\u2019s climate works and how climate change will impact the planet and its inhabitants over the course of the next century. A key part of the class is the labs that are based on real data and designed to provide you with a hands-on understanding of the course material.</p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s very important that you read emails. I will be in touch a lot during the semester so please take the time to read emails as it will help your progress and often save you time.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>I also make daily short announcements about cool topics in the climate arena. I often include tips about upcoming assignments so please listen to them!</strong><strong></strong></p>\n<p>As you will read in the syllabus and all-important Course Orientation, the class has weekly quizzes in addition to eight labs. All of these exercises are key to your understanding of the material. There is a Capstone discussion on Yellowdig which requires at least one entry and reply every week. Finally, there are two midterms for the course. More on the midterms and Yellowdig Capstone later on.</p>\n<p>The lab for the course is worth 30% and it uses a combination of Google Earth and STELLA. The latter program will be introduced in Module 3, but the former will be used in Module 1. It will be very important for you to get comfortable with it so I recommend you do the Google Earth Tutorial in the Orientation and I will post a tour in a day or so.</p>\n<p>My job is to help you learn about Earth and its future and I am truly passionate about making sure you get the most out of the course. At the same time, your experience in the class will be amplified if you keep up with the material. The class has 12 weekly modules and moves fast. Once you are done with one module, you move right on to the next one. <strong>If you fall a week behind, you will find it very hard to catch up. That is why quizzes and labs have firm deadlines and we will not bend the rules without a very legitimate excuse. We have to be very firm on this from the outset.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>All of the course materials can be found on Canvas. This is a WEB ONLY class and there are no (repeat no!) Zoom lectures! There is also no textbook.<br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>There is NO reading outside of the links on Canvas and the weekly Yellowdig Discussion.</strong></p>\n<p>I know many of you will actually want to work ahead and complete future weeks\u2019 assignments. Feel free to read the materials and prepare, but I cannot answer questions about future modules or I will be all over the place and the assignments are open only for a week.</p>\n<p>One final thing.<strong> We also use Yellowdig for informal questions. More on that in a few days.</strong></p>\n<p>That's it for now; please get working on the Course Orientation.</p>\n<p>Again, welcome to Earth 103!</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Tim Bralower</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

If we can understand how this system works, then we can make intelligent predictions about the climate in the future. The future of climate is of great importance to the quality of life in the future. In this class, we will explore the workings of the climate system \u2014 at the present, and in the past \u2014 through a series of modules with hands-on learning activities. We will learn how simple and sophisticated computer models can provide useful tools for making predictions about what our climate will be like in the next few hundred years, which will be a critical time for our species as we endeavor to find a more sustainable way of living. A changing climate means changes in, among other things, temperature and precipitation, which will affect our water supplies, our energy consumption, and our ability to grow enough food to feed the people of Earth. A changing climate also means a range of stresses on the global economy. We will examine these climate impacts, but we will not stop there \u2014 we will also focus our attention on what can be done to help us successfully meet these challenges.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete EARTH 103N should be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>explain how the climate system works, including something about its natural variability and the factors that drive climate change on a range of different timescales;</li>\n<li>understand how scientists approach the question of climate change through a combination of data, models, and hypotheses;</li>\n<li>explain the basic principles of climate models including their limitations and their uses, and what they predict about our future climate;</li>\n<li>explain the primary consequences of climate change for water and food supplies, coastal damages, relocation costs, energy consumption, and economic growth;</li>\n<li>explain the options for minimizing the effects of climate change and for adapting to a changing climate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Return to top</a></p>\n<hr style=\"border: 3px solid #1E407C;\">\n<p><a name=\"prerequisites\"></a></p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>None</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Return to top</a></p>\n<hr style=\"border: 3px solid #1E407C;\">\n<p><a name=\"expectations\"></a></p>\n<h2>What We Expect of You</h2>\n<p>On average, most students spend eight to ten hours per week working on course assignments. Your workload may be more or less depending on your prior experience with the energy topics we're covering and your familiarity with web-based classes.</p>\n<p>We have worked hard to make this an effective and engaging educational experience. You will succeed if you are diligent about keeping up with the class schedule and if you take advantage of opportunities to engage with both your classmates and your instructors throughout the course.</p>\n<p><strong>The key to success in this course is keeping up with the assignments. Students who complete the labs and quizzes on time have a good chance of success. If you fall behind, it is usually very difficult to catch up.</strong></p>\n<p>Specific learning objectives for each module and lab exercise are detailed within modules.</p>\n<h3>What You Can Expect From Me</h3>\n<p>I am excited about the topic of the class, and I love it when others get excited about this material too, so I will always be happy to answer your questions. I am using an online learning environment for this course, and as such, I will answer all questions via email. Please feel free to contact me with questions and I will respond to you within 24 hours in most cases (weekends and holidays being exceptions). If I am going to be out of touch for a while, I will let you know ahead of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Return to top</a></p>\n<hr style=\"border: 3px solid #1E407C;\">\n<p><a name=\"materials\"></a></p>\n<h2>Required Course Materials</h2>\n<h3>Software</h3>\n<p>Students should plan to use Google Earth Pro and Microsoft PowerPoint during the course. For this reason, <strong>you cannot take this class without access to a PC</strong> (Google Earth Pro will not run on phones and iPads). Many of the Labs will prompt you to download a Microsoft Word worksheet, but you may also use other note-taking software or applications such as Evernote or Microsoft OneNote to record notes and develop questions and ideas as you work through the course materials.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Textbooks</h3>\n<p>There is no textbook for you to buy for this course. All materials are presented online through Canvas. In order to access all materials, you need to have an active Penn State Access Account user ID and password (used to access the online course resources). If you have any questions about obtaining or activating your Penn State Access Account, please contact the <a href=\"http://itservicedesk.psu.edu/\">Penn State IT Service Desk</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>You will be required to purchase Yellowdig for weekly discussions.&nbsp;</strong>To get started with Yellowdig, click on the Yellowdig link in the left-hand navigation for this course section. You will need to create an account and pay the $12.95 fee for the semester.</p>\n<h3>Assistance with textbooks</h3>\n<p>Penn State honors and values the socioeconomic diversity of our students. If you require assistance with the costs of textbooks for this course, please contact your academic advisor.&nbsp;For additional needs, related to socioeconomic status, please visit <a href=\"https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/thecenter/project-cahir\">Project Cahir</a>&nbsp;or visit&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/studentcare\">Office of Student Care and Advocacy</a> at 222&nbsp;Boucke Building or call 814-863-2020.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Return to top</a></p>\n<hr style=\"border: 3px solid #1E407C;\">\n<p><a name=\"assignments\"></a></p>\n<h2>Assignments and Grading</h2>\n<h3>Lab Exercises 30%</h3>\n<p>Eight of the modules include a lab exercise that will engage you in studying data, maps, and models. These exercises build on the topics covered in the module and they will deepen and enhance your understanding of the material in that module.</p>\n<p><strong>Please read the following two paragraphs very carefully to avoid confusion!</strong></p>\n<p>Collectively, these lab exercises will make up 30% of your grade. The lab for each module will be weighted equally; your score for each will be converted to a percentage, and then I will take the mean of those percentages (throwing out the lowest grade) to calculate your final lab score. This class is 100% online. You will be submitting your answers in Canvas and they will be graded by Canvas. The advantage of this is you will get immediate feedback. All labs will be due Tuesday midnight of the week after the lab was started (i.e., Module 1 lab is due the Tuesday of the week you are working on Module 2).</p>\n<p>We will drop the lowest lab score.</p>\n<h3>Capstone Discussion 20%</h3>\n<p>The goal of the Discussion is to develop engaging conversations on the theme of the weekly module.&nbsp; Each week we will focus on different topics related to this theme and the current module. The goal is to take what you have learned in the module and synthesize it with your own research and analysis.&nbsp; You will be required to (1) submit an original entry every week and (2) to reply to other students\u2019 posts.&nbsp; Your grade will be based on how active you are. We use the Yellowdig platform for the discussion, as it offers a much better experience than traditional Canvas discussion boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yellowdig provides a gamified approach to engaging with your peers. There is a one-time fee of $12.95 to use the platform for the course.&nbsp; You'll be awarded points for your initial entry (provided it meets the required word count), then each time someone responds to your post, you also receive points. So, it's in your best interest to create thoughtful posts which will engage your peers in a meaningful discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will also receive points for replying to other students\u2019 posts.&nbsp; There is a leaderboard so you can see who is generating the highest quality posts and receiving the most responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each week I will give you a topic for the Discussion and you will be required to do some research beyond the course website. &nbsp;I recommend you write your entry in MS Word and proof it before cutting and pasting it into Yellowdig.&nbsp; Your original entry must include citations (any format is fine) but your replies to other students don\u2019t need to unless you use information from other original sources.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;More information will be provided during Module 1.</span></p>\n<h3>Two Midterm Exams @ 15% each</h3>\n<p>These exams will cover material related to the module content and the lab exercises. The \"Learning Outcomes\" at the beginning of each module provide a list of topics you should know about. <strong>The first exam will cover Modules 1-6 and the second exam covers Modules 7-12.</strong></p>\n<h3>Weekly Quizzes (total of 20%)</h3>\n<p>Students\u2019 understanding of the module content and lab exercises will be assessed through electronically administered and graded quizzes (in Canvas). The quizzes will be designed to assess the extent to which students have mastered the science presented in the modules. There are Practice Quizzes available for each module to help your study before taking the Graded Quiz. The lowest quiz score will be dropped. Most questions will be chosen from among the questions listed under \"Learning Outcomes\" at the beginning of each module. The quizzes must be taken by Sunday midnight of the week in question.</p>\n<p>Grades will be posted in Canvas with each assignment so that you can track your progress. The Capstone grade will be posted at the end of the semester.</p>\n<p>Final overall grades will be determined based on the sums of these elements. Your grade will be expressed as a percentage, with 100% being the unattainable perfect grade. We convert these scores to a letter grade as follows:</p>\n<h3>Course Grading Schedule</h3>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"1\" summary=\"summary\" cellpadding=\"15\"><caption style=\"vertical-align: top; font-size: 120%; text-align: left; color: #ffffff; background: #102644; padding: 5px 10px 5px 15px;\">Breakdown of each assignment's value as a percentage of the total course grade</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\">Letter Grade</th>\n<th scope=\"col\">Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lab Exercises</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capstone Discussion</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Midterm Exam #1</td>\n<td>15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Midterm Exam #2</td>\n<td>15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weekly Quizzes</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I will use the Canvas grade book to keep track of your grades.

track to reach our ultimate goal of understanding what the future of climate means for our future. We will reach this goal in small steps, and we need to pace ourselves so that we can really learn this material. If you do your best to follow this pace and meet the deadlines, you will succeed. If an emergency arises, let us know as soon as possible and we can work something out if there is a good excuse \u2014 we are not merciless, but at the same time, we have to be fair to others by not giving in to less serious requests for extensions.</p>\n<h3>Be professional</h3>\n<p>We will assume that everyone in the class is an adult and will behave with integrity. We expect that you will not lie or cheat and that you will adhere to all of Penn State's policies on academic integrity. Penn State defines academic integrity as \"the pursuit of scholarly projects in an open, honest and responsible manner.\" Academic integrity includes \"a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception.\" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as \"the fabrication of information and citations; submitting others' work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students' papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own.\" Penalties for violations of academic integrity may include course failure. If you are unclear about these policies, please review the material at the <a href=\"http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/\">Policies and Rules for Undergraduate Students</a> site. We also expect that you will treat your classmates and your instructor with respect. Climate change is an important topic with wide-reaching implications so that it has spilled out of the halls of science and into the more clamorous realm of politics, which is often ruled by opinions and beliefs rather than data. Politics is not science and it can often become personal; let us remember that this is a science class where we focus on the data rather than beliefs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#top\">Return to top</a></p>\n<hr style=\"border: 3px solid #1E407C;\">\n<p><a name=\"help\"></a></p>\n<h2>Getting Help</h2>\n<h3>Class Support Services</h3>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">World Campus students have access to tutoring in math, writing, and some business classes through <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/course-work-and-success/tutoring\" target=\"_blank\" data-extlink=\"\">Penn State Online. </a>Residential students have access to tutoring and guided study groups through <a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https://pennstatelearning.psu.edu/tutoring\" target=\"_blank\" data-extlink=\"\">Penn State Learning</a>.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical Help</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Online Course Content: If you experience technology problems in the external, online course content, please contact your Instructor. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Canvas: If you experience technology problems in Canvas, please contact <a href=\"https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=get_it_help\" target=\"_blank\" data-extlink=\"\">Penn State's IT Help Portal.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is in your own best interest to be as specific as you possibly can.

London in the 1960s often had thick smog due to the use of coal for heating, and Tim remembers his father walking along the side of the car on a foggy night to help his mother steer it through the streets. Tim attended Oxford University and received a BA in Earth Science. Weather was a big factor in his choice of graduate school, so Tim followed his undergraduate degree with a PhD in Earth Science at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego. Although a classically trained marine geologist, Tim\u2019s specialty is calcareous nannoplankton, a group of marine plankton that leave an exquisite fossil record. The nannoplankton allows us to tell time or date ancient sediments back to 225 million years ago, and, in addition, inform us about environments in the past. Recently, Tim has focused his research on ancient time periods when the climate warmed rapidly. In particular, he is interested in what happens to life during these episodes. The motivation for this research is to predict what will happen in the future as the ocean continues to heat up. He is also interested in mass extinction, in particular, the same event 65 million years ago that led to the demise of the dinosaurs, which almost eradicated the nannoplankton. The extinction and subsequent recovery of life in the ocean give us a worst-case scenario for how modern plankton may respond to drastic environmental change.</p>\n<p>Tim started his academic career as an Assistant Professor at Florida International University in Miami before moving to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he rose through the academic ranks to become Chair of the Department of Geological Sciences. Tim moved to Penn State in 2003 and was Head of the Department of Geosciences for a total of 9.5 years. Tim\u2019s research has taken him for fieldwork in Italy, much of the Western US, the Andes, and five ocean drilling expeditions. He recently served as a micropaleontologist on a rig that was set up to drill the Chicxulub crater off the coast of Mexico.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "content": "<h4><strong>Canvas</strong></h4>\n<p>Canvas is the learning management system currently being used by Penn State University. In Canvas, registered students may consult course calendars; communicate with instructors, teaching assistants, and fellow students; submit assignments; receive feedback from the instructor and teaching assistant; take online quizzes and surveys, and check assignment scores and course grades.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>The instructional materials for Earth 103N are also located here in Canvas. The course consists of 12 lessons (modules). Each lesson contains an introduction, lengthy presentation of the topic and a laboratory exercise. The lab exercises are a key part of the class, designed to provide you with a stronger grasp of the concepts in each module. Many of the lab exercises involve the use of Google Earth; you must have Google Earth Pro on your computer, and you must be familiar with how to use it to complete the labs. We will help you if it does not work on your computer. Note that you cannot use a phone or a tablet to use Google Earth for this class. There are no readings for the Modules outside of the extensive material on the website. However, the Capstone involves a lot of reading (see below). The Earth is very visual and we have incorporated a lot of images in the text, more than a typical online course. Some of the images are in boxes. Make sure that you take in these images as you read the text. The final element of the course are videos, both clips recorded by the instructor to explain tricky concepts and longer documentaries mostly on YouTube. Make sure you watch these videos.</p>\n<h4><strong>Yellowdig</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Yellowdig </strong>is the Discussion forum we use for this course. It also allows students to get help from the instructor and other classmates. Threaded discussions allow multiple posts and replies. More information on setting Yellowdig up is given below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>In general, questions and comments</strong> about project assignments, and course content <strong>should be shared with the entire class via Yellowdig</strong>. That way, everyone can benefit from the discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Course and Structure</h3>\n<h3>Topics of study</h3>\n<p>The content of this course is divided into 12 lessons (modules). Each module will be completed in approximately 1 week. The first six modules discuss the physical basis for climate change and the last six discuss the impact of change on natural systems as well as people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Module 1: Past Episodes of Climate Change</li>\n<li>Module 2: Recent Climate Change</li>\n<li>Module 3: Earth's Climate System</li>\n<li>Module 4: Introduction to General Circulation Models</li>\n<li>Module 5: Global Carbon Cycle</li>\n<li>Module 6: Ocean Circulation and its Impact on Climate</li>\n<li>Module 7: Ocean Acidification, Red Tides and Monster Jellyfish</li>\n<li>Module 8: Water Resources and Climate Change</li>\n<li>Module 9: Climate Change and Food Supply</li>\n<li>Module 10: Rising Seas</li>\n<li>Module 11: Terrestrial Ecosystems in Peril</li>\n<li>Module 12: Adaptation and Mitigation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Course assignments</h3>\n<p>Evaluation of student performance will be based on the following assignments:</p>\n<h4>Lab Exercises 30%</h4>\n<p>Eight modules include lab exercises that will engage you in studying data, maps, and models. These exercises build on the topics covered in the module and they will deepen and enhance your understanding of the material in that module.</p>\n<h2><strong>Please read the following two paragraphs very carefully to avoid confusion!</strong></h2>\n<p>The course is 100% online. You will be submitting your answers in Canvas and they will be graded by Canvas. The advantage of this is you will get immediate feedback. All labs will be due Tuesday midnight of the week after the lab was started (i.e. Module 1 lab is due the Tuesday of the week you are working on Module 2).</p>\n<p>Collectively, these lab exercises will make up 30% of your grade. The lab for each module will be weighted equally; your score for each will be converted to a percentage and then I will take the mean of those percentages (throwing out the lowest grade) to calculate your final lab score. <strong>If you miss a lab with no documented excuse, you will not get a score for that lab.</strong></p>\n<h4>Capstone Discussion: Earth in 2100 (20%)</h4>\n<p>The goal of the Discussion is to develop engaging conversations on the theme <em>Earth in the Year 2100</em>.&nbsp; Each week we will focus on a different topic related to this theme and the current module. The goal is to take what you have learned in the module and synthesize it with your own research and analysis.&nbsp; You will be required to (1) submit an original entry every week and (2) to reply to other students\u2019 posts.&nbsp; Your grade will be based on how active you are. We use the Yellowdig platform for the discussion as it offers a much better experience than traditional Canvas discussion boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yellowdig provides a gamified approach to engaging with your peers. There is a one-time fee of $12.95 to use the platform but you can then use it in this and other courses where it is required.&nbsp; You'll be awarded points for your initial entry (provided it meets the required word count), then each time someone responds to your post, you also receive points. So, it's in your best interest to create thoughtful posts which will engage your peers in a meaningful discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will also receive points for replying to other students\u2019 posts.&nbsp; There is a leaderboard so you can see who is generating the highest quality posts and receiving the most responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each week I will give you a topic for the Discussion and you will be required to do some research beyond the course website. &nbsp;I recommend you write your entry in MS Word and proof it before cutting and pasting it into Yellowdig.&nbsp; Your original entry must include citations (any format is fine) but your replies to other students don\u2019t need to unless you use information from other original sources.</p>\n<p>More information will be provided during the first week of class.</p>\n<h4>Two Midterm Exams (15% each)</h4>\n<p>These exams will cover material related to the module content, the readings, and the lab exercises. Discussion questions posted at the end of many of the lab exercises represent possible exam questions, so you should study these carefully. The \"Learning Outcomes\" in the blue boxes at the beginning of each module provide a list of topics you should know about. The first exam will be multiple choice and the second will be short answer. Each exam is weighted equally; the first exam will cover Modules 1-6 and the second exam covers Modules 7-12.</p>\n<h4>Weekly Quizzes (total of 20%)</h4>\n<p>Students\u2019 understanding of the module content and lab exercises will be assessed through electronically administered and graded quizzes (in Canvas). The quizzes will be designed to assess the extent to which students have mastered the science presented in the modules. The lowest grade will be dropped. Questions will be chosen from among the questions listed under \"Learning Outcomes\" in the blue boxes at the beginning of each module. The quizzes must be taken by Sunday midnight of the week in question.</p>\n<p>Grades will be posted in Canvas with each assignment so that you can track your progress. The Capstone grade will be posted at the end of the semester.</p>\n<p>Final overall grades will be determined based on the sums of these elements. Your grade will be expressed as a percentage, with 100% being the unattainable perfect grade.</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "content": "<h3>The Recipe for Success</h3>\n<p>In real estate, you hear the phrase,<em><strong> \"Location, Location, Location!\"</strong></em></p>\n<p>In music, as in sports, the phrase goes something like <strong><em>\"Practice, Practice, Practice!\"</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>And in the world of cooking, everyone knows that <strong><em>\"the better the batter, the better the cake!\"</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>In other words, what you put in greatly influences what you get out. And that is what this page is all about:&nbsp; <strong><em>Quality in - quality out.</em></strong></p>\n<h3>How To Succeed in an Online Course</h3>\n<p>For online courses, the advice most likely to lead you to success is <strong><em>\"Engage, Engage, Engage!\"</em></strong></p>\n<p>What does this mean? Quite simply, it means being active in the course on a regular basis. It means keeping in sync with what's going on in the course, staying on top of deadlines and assignments, asking for help when necessary, and taking every opportunity to interact with the content and the instructors. It means making EARTH 103 a regular part of your routine. Do this, and frankly, it will be difficult for you NOT to succeed in this course.</p>\n<p>In online courses, the role of both the instructors AND the students tends to shift from the traditional classroom roles. The instructors' role is similar to that of good supervisors, and the students' role is closer to that of a good employee. The instructors define and set overall goals, outcomes, and timelines; make the information, resources, and experiences available to you to meet those goals; and, provide the support, guidance, communication channels, and feedback to help you succeed. The students' primary responsibilities are to stay on task; to manage their time and energy in order to get everything done on a weekly basis; to ask for guidance when in need of clarification, and to take every opportunity available to improve their chances of success.</p>\n<p>So, the very best advice we can offer you is to be engaged in this course at least nine hours each week, and log on 5-6 days of the week to spread out your study and thinking time. In the final analysis, completing multiple online sessions of quality study time is a tried-and-true recipe for success in EARTH 103.</p>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid black; margin: 20px; padding: 10px;\">\n<h3>Six specific steps to help you succeed in this course</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Intentionally schedule your time!</strong> Treat this course like a traditional face-to-face course and you should be fine.\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule a time to read the instructional materials and take notes on what you read.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule a time to review your notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Schedule a time to do your assignments.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not procrastinate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a calendar program and set regular reminders for yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Read, Read, Read</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the Lesson overview and objectives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Read and take notes on all lesson materials including external readings, videos, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Read all email, discussion forum posts, and class announcements.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Read all the instructions that accompany all assignments\u2014they are there to help you succeed!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Take Notes</strong>!&nbsp; Again, treat this course just like a traditional face-to-face course.\n<ul>\n<li>Take notes when you read!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Write down what you don't understand and ask about it in the discussion boards.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communicate </strong>with the Instructors.\n<ul>\n<li>Use the Discussion Forums to ask general questions about the course set-up or content.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Email <strong>\"ALL COURSE FACULTY\"</strong> for private questions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be Familiar with all of the </strong><a href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361815/pages/technical-requirements?module_item_id=43303391\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361815/pages/technical-requirements\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\"><strong>Technical Requirements. </strong></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Just like other courses that have prerequisites, this course requires you to have certain technical specifications and knowledge.&nbsp; Do NOT bypass the tests on the Technical Requirements page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to do so may result in poor learning outcomes.&nbsp; Pay specific attention to the <a href=\"http://courses.worldcampus.psu.edu/public/diagnostics/general.shtml\">browser you are using</a>\u2014this is critical to your success in EARTH 103!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Understand</strong><strong> and know how to use</strong><strong> Canvas.&nbsp;</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Review the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/1780857\">PSU Canvas Student Orientation.</a>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Become familiar with where things are located and when things are due.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the Canvas help if you have questions (question mark icon on the lower left-hand side of the Canvas page).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "content": "<h3>Google Earth</h3>\n<p>Google Earth is an incredible geospatial tool that can be used for a wide variety of educational and research purposes. This digital globe software is very easy to use. Individuals can download the software for free and can easily browse, carry out inquiry, create new knowledge and data, and can save and share information using KMZ data files, or you can easily output the content as image files for incorporation into presentations or reports. Google Earth is a great research tool and with it anyone can collect information. A wide-range of Imagery including historical imagery contains a great deal of information about both natural and human landscapes around the Earth's surface. Street View functionality is also expanding in major cities and some rural areas and this adds an incredible array of 360\u00b0 panoramic views as though the user were actually in place on the street. Built in features also provide terrain views to add to 3-D visualization. A whole range of additional tools (measuring tools, image overlay tools, video touring tools, and others) allow for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of landscapes through time. Google Earth layers offer additional geographic information sorted by thematic area, provide labels, political boundaries, and more. Google Earth is also searchable and allows you to fly to most any location by name or coordinates.</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, this software will be the principal tool that will be used in this course to help you develop critical geospatial skills.</p>\n<h4>Download the Software</h4>\n<p>Go to the&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/\">Google Earth</a> website and download the <strong>Google Earth Pro</strong> version for your computer.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Install the Software</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Find and double-click the GoogleEarth<em>ComputerType</em>Pro.dmg file. The file name will change a little depending what type of computer you have.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Next use the Google Earth Installer&nbsp;that will be displayed to install the software. Start by clicking the icon that is displayed.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions to complete the process.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Tutorials and Resources from Google Earth</h4>\n<p>Note: There are a number of instructional elements on the Google Earth Help Center, so make sure you refer to the Help Center when necessary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/earth/?page=guide_toc.cs#topic=4363013\">Getting started resources </a>from the Google Earth Help Center website</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/google_earth/UserGuide.html\">The Science Education Resource Center (SERC)</a> has an extensive tutorial document that is extremely useful.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Google Earth Video Tutorial (20:27)</h4>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/kkiIbzKTtJw?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"toggler\" aria-label=\"expand content\"><strong>Video transcript.</strong></div>\n<div aria-label=\"additional content\">In this tutorial we're going to spend a little bit of time focusing on the tools within Google Earth. When you open Google Earth you'll see this screen. A couple of the things that I want to point out to you are the header bars and tools that are available here. The first one you'll notice is the search bar at the top left-hand corner of the screen. Anytime you can type in a location that you're interested to find. For instance, if you're interested in Adelaide, South Australia, you click on that and hit Search. Google Earth will zoom in to the location that you typed in. In this case you can see we've zoomed in on Adelaide, South Australia. And you can continue to zoom in to see other features; and you can even type in street addresses and other locations. You can also use latitude and longitude here, as well, to find a location. What are some of the other tools? First off you'll notice that down in the lower right-hand side of the screen you\u2019ll notice latitude and longitude and elevation of wherever your cursor is. So as you zoom in to this coastline, and of course you can see in this particular view, as you zoom, an ocean-going vessel underway, going up this particular river. But you can see that the latitude and longitude is shown, as well as the imagery day of the image. So this image was from January 30th 2010. Okay. So it's a lot of information that's available. In terms of navigating, up in the upper right hand corner, you can use the compass tool, or the GOI tool, and you can spin the view at any point, and you can choose the perspective. And you just have to play around with those tools to become comfortable with them. You can use your mouse, if you have a roller ball, and you can zoom in and zoom out fairly simply. Or you can double click on features and you can zoom in and out of those features. So that's an interesting tool. So here you can see a beautiful mangrove system on these tidal creeks leading into this river system here going out into the ocean. Other tools. Okay, so up here at the top you'll see the placemark tool. So if you're interested in labeling a feature and you want to make sure that you are able to find that feature in the future, you can just identify that. You click on the placemark tool and while the dialog box is open, you can click on the placemark and you can move it to wherever you would like to on the screen and you can name it. And you can also change the color. There's a number of different versions, so if you wanted the color code features you certainly could do that. You can change the color of your pin. We'll change it to blue. And again, you can do any number of different things that are here. Okay, so that makes that pretty easy. So notice now when I change, it's in the green situation. You can change the labeling. So the Adelaide, Australia, if you want to change that to a different color, you can do that. Notice now I just changed it to yellow. And the icon itself you can change as well. You can change different colors that way. So it's pretty simple. And notice now that I close that, the pin location is here. In this case it's in the temporary places folder. And this is really important, so what I would like you to do is add a folder here. Anytime you're working in Google Earth and you want to retain information, add a folder and you should name that according to your projects. A good way to do that is project module 1, for instance if you were working on an assignment for module 1. And you can you can click OK and then easily once you have made your folder you can move your placemarks into that folder. Now the big thing, before you exit out of Google Earth, make sure you move that into your \u201cmy places\u201d folder. That way you will be able to save it by right clicking \u201cSave place as\u201d and you can save it to any location that you would like save it to. You can navigate to your documents and you can in a place it there, so that's pretty simple. I'm not going to save mine at the moment but we'll leave it there. So that's the placemark tool. What are some of the other tools that you can find? Well we have a \u201cadd a polygon\u201d tool. So for instance if we wanted you to, or if you wanted to measure the area of a particular coastal feature or of a town. So if we are here for instance, you have a number of impoundments that have been clearly developed here as flood control structures. If we wanted to measure the area of those or we wanted to highlight those features, again you click on the button and you can simply click and drag around the area. And you can be very precise with this, I'm just doing it very sort of cursory. And you can use your arrow keys to move if you have to. Now notice I didn't like the way those buttons, so I can hit the delete button rather than the return. Just hit the delete and I can undo whatever it was that I had just pinned and so there I have completed my polygon and I can you know name it whatever I would like to, Area One. And I could even add a description, so if I wanted to say this was an impoundment, you know we could do that. You could also add a link to a website if you found information out about it. Or you can add information, an image to your content description. Whatever you put in this description box, it will be there for you when you click on that feature. So you see area one impoundment, everything is there. Now if you close out of a feature that you've already identified and you would like to go back in and modify it, it's really simple. You come over to your places box on the left hand side. You right click on there with your mouse and you come down to properties. So at any time you can come back in here and you can add or edit any information. So I want to change my line color, maybe I want to change my fill color. Now what if I wanted to actually see this in a little bit of a transparency. So what you can do is here in the opacity, we can take that down to say 20 percent or we can take it down to 30 percent, whatever you would like to do. The same goes with the opacity of the line color that you run around the outside perimeter. Whichever you do, you're just going to need to hit okay and it's easy for you to go back to those points. Now notice I'm now navigated away from the very first point that I had done. And if I want to go back to that at any point, I can just click on that location on that point and it will zoom me back to the location I was at when I placed that pin. Let's just try for another. Let\u2019s go for Beijing China. We'll see what we can find out about Beijing and then we'll use another tool there. So notice I'm flying or navigating to Beijing. And you can see that Beijing is located sort of to the west of the ocean, but it's a fairly large city. So let\u2019s sort of zoom in on some of the coastal features here just a little and you'll notice that we have a very large port area. So for instance, if we wanted to measure the distance between Beijing, and we\u2019ll go ahead and we\u2019ll do a ruler tool here. The first thing I want to do is I'm going to put a placemark, and we'll put it down here, just so that it\u2019s a reference. And we\u2019ll just say \u201cnearest port to Beijing\u201d, and we hit okay. And now if I wanted to measure the distance how am I going to measure that distance? Now I can click up here on the ruler tool and I have a couple of different options that I can follow here. First of all, I can use the line tool and I can just simply click. And now this is in meters or I can switch it to kilometers or I can switch it to miles, whatever units you would like. When you're doing long distances it is wise for you to use, obviously a larger scale, for instance kilometers. So in this particular case you'll notice that the distance from my Beijing City Center to the nearest port, as the crow would fly, is 157 kilometers. And that's also at a heading of a hundred and thirty degrees. So in other words, this is north, as we all know is a zero degree reading on a compass. So if I were to go from Beijing China to the port, I would be going to South East at a bearing of a hundred and thirty degrees, to get from Beijing to that port. Okay now another thing that you can do, instead of just doing a simple straight line as the crow would fly, you might want to know the path. So for instance, if you wanted to follow a road or a river. So here you can see one of the rivers. It's very simple for you. You can click on the image and again here I'm going to use my arrow keys to trace out the river system. So I'm going to continue to do that. As I follow this river I\u2019m going to arrow over. For a boat to make it to Beijing from the port city, rather than going by airplane or as a crow would fly. Notice here that that path that I chose, it is a very rough path, it's not precise. You can be certainly much more careful with your clicking. It's roughly 200 kilometers to travel that distance. At any time, you can always hit clear and you can go back. Now if you want to upgrade to Google Earth Pro you can also do lots of areas and perimeters and other kinds of things, which are very interesting, as you develop your abilities. Pretty neat tool to do here. So when you're ready to close that go ahead. So we've covered the \u201cadd a placemark\u201d tool and the \u201cpolygon tool\u201d and let's talk a little bit about a line or a path. So just as I did before, this is a way for us to actually label a path that\u2019s on this stream, so I'm just going to go ahead and I'm gonna click a path that I might want to follow, not necessarily you know okay perfect one. But so there's a path and if I wanted to say this was a transportation route for instance, I could do that. And add any kind of a description in here. So there it is and notice it's still in the projects bar, module one at any time that I'm interested to go back to a site. So what if I wanted to go back to Adelaide? Again I could just click on Adelaide and I can fly all the way back down there. Okay so that's pretty simple. And as I zoom in again you can see the polygons, that was my impoundment, and here's of course Adelaide itself. All right so the only other tool that I was going to point out at this point, well there are two more tools that I want to point out. One of them is what's called the \u201cadd an image overlay\u201d tool. If there was a map or other image that you would like to add, you would click on that new image overlay and you would browse for that map and you could insert it. And once it's inserted you can rotate the map to align it with your geology or you can drag the corners and make it smaller or larger. Ok, again you can shift the center of it around. So there's a lot of neat things that you can do with this tool and this is really, in a GIS environment, what is called georeferencing. So you can take any map, any image that you would have as a JPEG or a PNG file and insert it in here, and you can align it to the map. And if you want to be able to see through your map, to be able to register it, sometimes it's really useful to use the opacity or transparency function to be able to see it as well. So I'm never going to have finished this one because obviously I haven't selected a map but that's something that you could do easily enough. The last tool what I want to point out to you in terms of you know workable tools that are useful for you, one of them is right here. It's called the record a tool and this will allow you to make interesting video captures of features that you want to see. And so a little dialog box that opens on the screen, you can notice that there's a microphone and that there is a record button. So anything that you do from the point that you click on that button you will be able to record. So at this point I'm going to zoom into area one and you'll notice that down here it's clicking off so it's recording everything that I'm doing. And if I wanted to zoom in on another area, okay I could click on that area on that feature and as you zoom in, it\u2019s recording your activity. So as we zoom in here you can see that this is probably a river channel, that's obviously covered in a lot of trees and it's probably a freshwater system or at least mostly freshwater, that it clearly must have some saltwater influence on it, so it may even have some tidal component to it. But that's beside the point of this at this point in time. So I will go ahead and hit stop and immediately my video will start playing and I have the option of watching that video to see if it's if it's exactly what I want. And if it's what I like, and I'm happy with the video, I can hit the save the video and save it to your places and it will always be a video that you can share with anybody easily enough. So I can hit share and I can call that one a quick tour of Adelaide. So I\u2019ll hit save and notice it also comes into my and to my folder for my project. As long as that's where I've been working that's where it will be. And when I'm ready to finish this project, it's very easy for me to go here and hit save place as and I can save it to any folder I want to save it to. Okay so there I have my tool I have the tools, and that would be the important part one. Oh one more item that I meant to mention here. The historical imagery tool. So we will zoom back out for a minute and if I'm interested to see how this landscape might be changing, I can certainly turn on a historical imagery tool. You'll notice that up pops this little box, and if you look closely here there are several images that are posted here. I can go back in time to, in this case this is March 17, 2005 January 15, 2004, April 25th 2003. Now not all images are very perfect for all areas, because of course depends on the quality of the imagery that was taken at that time, but if we wanted to zoom in and see some of the changes that do take place. Okay you can see there are some referencing images issues here, so sometimes it may not be the best. For some regions you'll get very excellent data. So again that historical imagery tool and you can turn it back off if you don't want to see it. Alright so there's a very quick set of instructions showing you what's going on in Google Earth and how to use some of the tools. And there are certainly a number of other ones that are available to you online via the Google Earth website itself. So that will help you hopefully, this will help you. If you have any questions on Google Earth feel free to ask your instructors.</div><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "content": "<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>Academic Integrity is one of the six <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://universityethics.psu.edu/penn-state-values\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State Values</a>&nbsp;that all students are expected to uphold. As stated in University Faculty Senate <a href=\"http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#49-20\">Policy 49-20</a>:</p>\n<p>\u201cAcademic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.\"</p>\n<p>Additionally, academic integrity includes \"a commitment not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation, or deception.\" In particular, the University defines plagiarism as \"the fabrication of information and citations; submitting other's work from professional journals, books, articles, and papers; submission of other students\u2019 papers, lab results or project reports and representing the work as one's own.\" Penalties for violations of academic integrity policy may include forfeited assignments, course failure, or disqualification from a degree or certificate program.</p>\n<p>We don't expect that any of our students would willfully violate the University's Academic Integrity policy, but it is important that you are fully aware of it so that you don't inadvertently violate the policy. The majority of students who have taken this class in the past have not cheated on purpose. There have been, however, more than a few students have submitted assignments that violate academic integrity standards of the University. In most cases this is due to inadequate awareness of our expectations, poor paraphrasing, and citation errors. Your good faith participation in this assignment should minimize that risk for you.</p>\n<h2>Expectations</h2>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">We expect our students to be able to:</div>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Paraphrase an original source properly. Recognize an inadequate paraphrase and explain why it's inadequate,</li>\n<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1518057033544_47423\" dir=\"ltr\">Quote original material properly, including different typographical formats for short quotes and extended quotes. Recognize over-reliance on quotations vis a vis original text. For EARTH 103, use quotations sparingly. <strong>Only use quotations when someone says something.</strong></li>\n<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1518057033544_47433\" dir=\"ltr\">Cite paraphrases, quotations and graphics adequately and consistently. An adequate citation includes enough information to find the associated reference in a footnote or at the end of the work.</li>\n<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1518057033544_47467\" dir=\"ltr\">Reference cited works adequately and consistently. An adequate reference includes enough information to find the original version of the cited work in a library or online - even after the URL expires. In EARTH 103, we use <a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations\" target=\"_blank\">APA style guide.</a> (Published reference styles like APA are recommended, but not required unless a work is to be published formally.<strong> For this course, however, citations are required.</strong>)</li>\n<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1518057033544_47442\" dir=\"ltr\">Explain why it's wrong to produce a report that does not fulfill the first four objectives.</li>\n<li id=\"yui_3_16_0_1_1518057033544_47448\" dir=\"ltr\">Recognize the penalties that the University authorizes for violations of academic integrity.</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Understand that the copyright of the materials in this class, including the course website, the quizzes and labs belong to Penn State and the professor. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Distribution of these materials (for example on CourseHero, Chegg, Discord, Quizlet or elsewhere) is strictly illegal, is a serious academic integrity violation and will result in academic integrity sanctions</span>.<br></strong></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Use of ChatGPT or any AI writing generator is strictly prohibited.</strong></li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Understand that all Quizzes and Midterms are Closed Book.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<p><em>Note: This assignment should take no more than 45 minutes of your time to complete.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Carefully read the University Faculty Senate <a href=\"http://senate.psu.edu/policies-and-rules-for-undergraduate-students/47-00-48-00-and-49-00-grades/#49-20\">Policy 49-20 Academic Integrity</a>.<br><br></li>\n<li>Watch the 14-minute video called <a class=\"\" href=\"https://youtu.be/qoCdhJsS6Bw\">Summarizing, Paraphrasing, and Quoting: A Guide to Doing it Right!</a><br><br></li>\n<li>Review the <a title=\"Citation and Reference Style Guide\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361815/pages/citation-and-reference-style-guide\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361815/pages/citation-and-reference-style-guide\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Citation and Reference Style Guide</a>, which focuses on correct APA citation and reference style.<br><br></li>\n<li>Read and familiarize yourself with the <a id=\"165480876\" class=\"instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361815/files/170652524?verifier=BkWcnIm5SEuCyhkre7yyjd692NRR2lYAk6vOHMPy&amp;wrap=1\" target=\"_blank\" data-canvas-previewable=\"true\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361815/files/170652524\" data-api-returntype=\"File\">Dos and Don't of using ChatGPT</a>.<br><br></li>\n<li>Complete <a class=\"external\" href=\"http://academicintegrity.psu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State's Academic Integrity training </a>and score an at least an 80 on the training's <a class=\"external\" href=\"https://academicintegrity.psu.edu/courses/academic-integrity/conclusion/final-assessment\" target=\"_blank\">Final Assessment</a>.<br><br></li>\n<li>Upload a screenshot or a PDF of your certificate.

At the same time these tools can be used in ways that are not legitimate.&nbsp; For example, you cannot use ChatGPT to write any part of your assessments or to answer quiz questions for you.&nbsp; Both of these uses are considered violations of academic integrity and will incur serious penalties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Below are legitimate ways you can use artificial intelligence as well as examples that are not considered legitimate in this course.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Legitimate uses of Generative AI Tools</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using for research before writing a post for Yellowdig. If you do this make sure you cite AI assistance in your reference list.</li>\n<li>Using it to proofread your Yellowdig entries</li>\n<li>Asking questions about study material you don\u2019t understand</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Illegitimate uses of Generative AI Tools</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t ask AI software to write Yellowdig entries for you. This is a form of plagiarism and as such is a breach of academic integrity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">You might not realize but professors are pretty good at detecting language that is AI generated.&nbsp; It is robotic and often uses words that are not natural choices in topics like the ones you will be writing about in this class. We can use ChatGPT checkers to determine the probability that text is AI generated.&nbsp; So, the bottom line is you will likely not get away with using ChatGPT to write for you, so please don\u2019t use it</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t blindly trust AI-generated information. Especially with very technical information we present in this course, AI will often give you the wrong answers. Specifically for quizzes, we have intentionally modified questions to make them more complex so that AI will either fail to give you an answer or give you the wrong answer.</li>\n</ul><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

Yellowdig is used for for the discussion as it offers a much better experience than traditional Canvas discussion boards.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Yellowdig is the online conversation platform that we will be using for <em>Earth in the Future</em>. You receive points for participating in Yellowdig conversations, and the points you receive in Yellowdig factor into your final grade. Each week, you can earn up to <strong>1000 <em></em>points</strong>. To get an \"A\" on the Yellowdig assignment, you must have at least <strong><i></i>12,000</strong><strong> points</strong> by the end of the course. If you reach the weekly max by the end of each week, you are guaranteed to get an \"A\" on the Yellowdig assignment which is worth 20% of your final grade.</span></p>\n<p>Yellowdig provides a gamified approach to engaging with your peers. There is a one-time fee of $12.95 to use the platform for the course. You'll be awarded points for your initial entry (provided it meets the required word count), then each time someone responds to your post, you also receive points. So, it's in your best interest to create thoughtful posts which will engage your peers in a meaningful discussion. <strong>It will also benefit you to post early in the week,</strong> Thursday by the latest, as more students will have the opportunity to respond to you. You will also receive points for replying to other students\u2019 posts. There is a leader board so you can see who is generating the highest quality posts and receiving the most responses.</p>\n<p><strong>Each week you should focus on topics related to the weekly module. For the discussion you will need to do some research beyond the course website.</strong> I recommend you write your entry using Google Voice and MS Word and proof it before cutting and pasting it into Yellowdig. Your original entry must include citations (any format is fine) but your replies to other students don\u2019t need to unless you use information from other original sources.</p>\n<h3><strong>Here is a summary of the rules:</strong></h3>\n<h4><em>The Goal</em></h4>\n<p>The goal of the discussion is for you to integrate what you have learned in the module with independent research and analysis on topics related to it. You should be synthesizing information in that module with your own research. Personal opinions on topics that will foster positive discussion are encouraged.</p>\n<h4><strong>Weekly Post and Response </strong></h4>\n<p>You will be required to post once a week and to reply to a classmate's post. The system will monitor your posts and the number of responses you receive. You will get the hang of it over the course of the first few weeks. The more peers you post comments on, the more point you will accrue.</p>\n<h4><em>Research</em></h4>\n<p>I suggest that you use sources like the New York Times, Washington Post, Scientific American, or Google Scholar to do your research. Wikipedia is also a possibility but it is less likely to be original than other sources, so I recommend you search more broadly. You can use the course website but you must use additional sources. Remember the more original your post is the more likely you will get responses to it.</p>\n<h4><em>Initial Entry</em></h4>\n<p><strong>Your initial or primary post must be more than 75 words. </strong>We advise you to submit it early in the week, the earlier you post this entry the more responses you are likely to get, and these responses will improve your score. Please make sure that you write in your own words and paraphrase all quotes. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">T<strong>his means absolutely no direct copying from your sources will be tolerated including copying with quotation marks</strong></span><strong>. We can also identify text written by AI or ChatGPT. </strong>Make sure you write clearly and stay on topic. I highly recommend you write your initial post as well as your replies in Word so you can proof them before submitting. Word will also check for spelling and grammatical mistakes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You earn more points for a great initial entry. Your peers are your judges and when they respond to your post because it interests or resonates with them, you get points. So you will be rewarded for doing great research and generating an excellent and thoughtful original post. Feel free to add images and videos to bring your post to life, but these are not essential or required. The main thing is that a quality post based on solid research will get you credit. Also, early entries will get more points because more students will get to respond to them before the deadline. To earn as many points as possible, you are strongly encouraged to contribute to our Yellowdig Community early and often.</span></p>\n<h4><em>Responses to other students\u2019 posts</em></h4>\n<p>You must reply to at least one other student\u2019s post each week by Saturday midnight, however, to accrue 1000 points, you will need to reply to more than one of your peers if others are not replying to your post. The idea is to <span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><span style=\"font-style: normal;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">r<span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-style: normal;\">eward your peers for producing excellent content by commenting on and reacting to their posts</span>. </span></strong></span></span>Responses must be at least 25 words long long. Please try and make this reply thoughtful with substance, comments as well as disagreements. It is not enough to say things like \u201cI agree with you.\u201d</p>\n<h4><strong>Grading </strong></h4>\n<p>The grading of these posts and responses is based on how much you engage. The more you interact both replying to other students\u2019 posts and having them reply to yours, the higher your grade will be. I will moderate the discussion and points will be deducted for factually erroneous posts, those that are not on topic and those that copy directly from the source (including in parentheses). Points will also be deducted for posts of comments that are rude or lack respect for other students\u2019 points of view as well as for plagiarism.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">The grading period for each Yellowdig module/week will begin on Sunday morning <strong><em></em></strong>and end on the following <strong>Saturday at midnight</strong>. Your Yellowdig grade is worth <strong><em>20%</em></strong> of your final grade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You receive points for interacting and engaging with your peers in the following ways:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Writing an Initial Post of at least <strong>75</strong> words (<strong><i>280 </i></strong>points) as early as possible.<br></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Writing a Comment of at least <strong>25</strong> words (<strong>210</strong> points) by Saturday midnight.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving a Comment on your Post (<strong>70 </strong>points)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving an Accolade on your Post or Comment (Points vary):</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving a Reaction on your Post or Comment (50 points</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">The goal is to reach the weekly target of 1000 points to get you an A in the Capstone, but we have an additional great feature which is a buffer of 35% or 350 points, this allows you to make up for weeks that you have scored lower or missed posting. <strong>There is no way for me to adjust points in Yellowdig if you miss posting for any reason.</strong> You will have to use this buffer. Once you cannot earn 1350 points there is no way to earn any more until the weekly reset deadline on Sunday morning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Yellowdig passes back your Yellowdig grade to Canvas<strong><em></em></strong>as a proportion (a percentage) that represents your current <em>pace</em> toward getting an \"A\" in Yellowdig. Therefore, the points you see in Yellowdig might not match the points you see in Canvas. I will hide the Yellowdig score in Canvas to avoid confusion. To see how you are doing, look in Yellowdig. If any of this confuses you, just remember:<em> if you end every week with a Yellowdig grade of 100%, you are guaranteed to get an \"A\" in Yellowdig</em>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">You will learn how your activity impacts your score over the first week or two and then you can modify your subsequent entries based on that knowledge. Your lowest week\u2019s score is dropped, so you can use the first week as a learning experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Our Community will thrive when we treat each other with respect and sensitivity. We will be adopting Yellowdig's <a href=\"https://support.yellowdig.co/hc/en-us/articles/14092258648980\">code of conduct</a> for this course. <strong><em>[I also remind you of our institution's policies around student conduct: Link to or list additional ground rules]</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><em>Timing</em></p>\n<p>For each module the Discussion will open on Monday and stay open till Sunday midnight. You must complete your initial entry and your responses to other students\u2019 posts by Sunday midnight. <strong>Absolutely no extensions will be given under any circumstance.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>How to get started </strong></h3>\n<p>To get started with Yellowdig, click on the Yellowdig link in the left hand navigation for this course section.

If you are not attending class in person, you should be watching the videos. The videos provide the same amount/level of coverage of the content as the in-person sections (so roughly 2.5 hours of lecture videos per week).</li>\n<li>Attend Friday labs. During Lab, the TAs go over course concepts and problems associated with the homework.\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>We also have Tuesday lab where the TAs cover different problems than the Friday labs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Attend TA or Instructor office hours.\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The Office Hours are listed on the \u201cMeet Your Instructors\u201d Canvas page. We have several qualified and experienced TAs who have over 25 hours of open office hours in person and via Zoom every week. These TAs were all vetted by our team and are your first source of help.</li>\n<li>We also have 3 amazing professors for our course. These professors have office hours at various times during the week. You may speak to any of the professors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Complete all homework and extra credit assignments without looking at the solution first. Once the assignment has closed, you can complete the non-graded assignments for extra practice.</li>\n<li>Do the sample exams to prepare.</li>\n<li>Watch the Exam Reviews that are created by the instructors.</li>\n</ol>\n</details><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

These tasks may include problem-solving, language understanding, and interaction.</p>\n<p>GenAI refers to a category of artificial intelligence technologies designed to generate new content, such as text, images, video, audio, or code, that is similar to what a human might produce. This is achieved through algorithms, often based on neural networks, which learn patterns and structures from large datasets (OpenAI, 2024).</p>\n<p>There are a variety of ethical considerations surrounding AI, including bias, privacy, transparency, and copyright concerns. We encourage you to consider these as you create your AI policy.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more, please visit the <a href=\"https://guides.libraries.psu.edu/c.php?g=1338692&amp;p=9866318\" target=\"_blank\">Penn State Library Guide on Generative AI: ChatGPT and Beyond</a> or refer to the additional resources listed on our website.</p>\n<h2>Generative Artificial Intelligence Overview</h2>\n<p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has created a new landscape for students and instructors. It's essential that members of this course understand how GenAI can impact their learning journey and the importance of approaching GenAI use responsibly. The following guidelines are designed to help you and ensure a successful semester.</p>\n<div style=\"margin: 1.5rem 2rem; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border-radius: 6px; border: 1px solid #404040; background: #f5f5f5; overflow: auto;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 60px;\" src=\"https://courses.smeal.psu.edu/media/GenAI-red.png\" alt=\"GenAI Prohibited Icon\" loading=\"lazy\"><strong>Guidelines for Using GenAI in this Course</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Course Policy: </strong>In this course, the use of GenAI is prohibited.</li>\n<li><strong>Responsibility: </strong>You are responsible for the work you submit for grading to ensure Academic Integrity compliance. Unless your instructor specifically tells you otherwise, you may not use any GenAI tool for any course assignments.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>Course GenAI Policy</h2>\n<p>The use of GenAI is prohibited in this course for all assignments. This policy applies to the use of all GenAI tools, including but not limited to ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Quillbot, Penn State's freely available version of Copilot, etc., and is reflective of the notion that your personal mastery of the course material is front and center. There will be courses in your educational career where GenAI is allowed or even encouraged--it can be an important collaborative tool that graduates will need for their careers. This is not one of those courses, and if the instructor finds evidence of plagiarism of any kind, the appropriate punitive actions will be taken.</p>\n<p>According to Faculty-Senate Policy G-9, \"Academic Integrity, misrepresenting another's words, results, processes, or ideas in whole or in part without giving appropriate attribution, citation, or credit is an academic integrity violation.\" This includes submitting GenAI output as one's own (e.g., plagiarism).</p>\n<p>Please refer to the university policies regarding academic integrity in part 2 of the syllabus. This provides more in-depth details about university and college processes involving plagiarism and the <a href=\"https://www.smeal.psu.edu/integrity/integrity-violation-process\" target=\"_blank\">Academic Integrity Violation Process</a>, as well as the values outlined in the Smeal Honor Code.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "content": "<p>First, it is important for us to repeat that the subject of Accounting is best learned through practice. So we will provide a variety of McGraw-Hill assignments during the semester to help you \"practice, practice, practice\" the course material. The McGraw-Hill assignments provided to you throughout this semester will include:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li><strong>SB - SMARTBOOK (Non-Graded) </strong>- these flashcard type assignments encourages you to read the book PRIOR to attending class or watching online videos. Being prepared for class will help you better understand the lessons.</li>\n    <li><strong>LP - LECTURE &amp; LAB PROBLEMS (Non-Graded) - </strong>not found in Connect but please practice problems presented in class or in online videos.</li>\n    <li><strong>HW - HOMEWORK (Graded)</strong> - these graded assignments are intended to provide intermediate-to-advanced-level practice questions which you should be able to solve in the middle of each Lesson (after starting the \"Read\" and \"Watch\" portions of the \"Read-Watch-Do-Review\" process). Make sure you complete each of these assignments by the due date listed in Connect (each due date is also listed in the \"Course Calendar\" on Canvas).</li>\n    <li><strong>EP - EXTRA PRACTICE (Extra Credit) </strong>- these optional extra credit assignments are intended to provide a set of advanced-level practice questions which you should be able to solve at the end of each Lesson (after completing the \"Read,\" \"Watch,\" and \"Do\" portions of the \"Read-Watch-Do-Review\" process). These optional extra credit assignments can also be used to help prepare you for each of the exams in the course. <span style=\"background-color: #fbeeb8;\"><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: THESE OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT ASSIGNMENTS ARE THE ONLY EXTRA CREDIT ASSIGNMENTS IN THE COURSE</strong>.</span> If you wish to complete these optional extra credit assignments, then please make sure that you complete the assignments by the due date listed in Connect (each due date is also listed in the \"Course Calendar\" on Canvas).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Specific Tips for Navigating the HW - HOMEWORK (Graded) and the EP - EXTRA PRACTICE (Extra Credit) Assignments:</h2>\n<p>HW and EC assignments may be completed an unlimited number of times prior to the assignment due date and your highest score will be used in determining your final grade.</p>\n<p>A \"<strong>Check Answer</strong>\" button is available. Clicking this button will reveal if you have successfully completed the <span>assignment</span> question. <span style=\"background-color: #fbeeb8;\"><i>You will have five attempts</i> to check your answer </span>when navigating each graded assignment question. After the five attempts if you want to earn a higher grade on that assignment you will have to restart the assignment. As mentioned <span style=\"background-color: #fbeeb8;\">you have unlimited attempts on the HW and EC assignments</span>.</p>\n<p>Graded homework (HW) is assigned for each of the 12 Lessons of the course through McGraw-Hill Connect. The McGraw-Hill Connect content will be organized by Lesson. There will be 12 homework opportunities. You will have unlimited attempts at each homework (i.e. you can do the HW as many times as you wish before the deadline), and your highest homework score will be used in determining your final grade.</p>\n<p>Each homework must be completed by the due date/time established in the Course Calendar. Once a graded homework closes, <strong>it cannot be re-opened</strong> for any reason. However, students can continue to review their submitted homework as part of their continued practice of the course material. We will enable \"study attempts\" after the due date for the assignment closes.</p>\n<p>To assist students with any technical issues, personal extenuating circumstances, or illness during a Lesson, we will drop the two lowest Homework scores earned. Therefore, the 10 highest Homework scores will be used toward your final grade, and each assignment is worth 2%</p>\n<p>Students may earn extra credit by completing the Lesson Extra Practice (EP) via McGraw-Hill Connect for each Lesson. There are 12 EP (Extra Credit) opportunities, one for each of the 12 Lessons of the course. Each EP (Extra Credit) allows you to earn up to 0.33% extra credit toward your final course grade. You may take each EP (Extra Credit) an unlimited number of times, and the highest score will be used toward the Extra Credit (for example: if your highest score on an EP assignment for the Lesson is 90%, you would earn 90% of .33, or .297, in Extra Credit toward your final grade).</p>\n<p>All of the EP (Extra Credit) for a Module will stay open until 11:59 p.m. on the night of the scheduled exam (see the Course Calendar for specific dates/times). <span style=\"background-color: #fbeeb8;\"><strong>The EP (Extra Credit) is designed to be attempted/taken at the completion of each <em>Lesson</em>. You may also take them again in the days before an Exam for study purposes; however, please do not wait until the last days before an exam to attempt all of the EP (Extra Credit) for the first time for the entire Module. If you do, you may find there is not enough time to complete them and/or fully understand the Lesson material. </strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>Once the EP (Extra Credit) closes, it cannot be re-opened for any reason, and there will be no further Extra Credit opportunities for that Module. Likewise, extensions will not be granted for EP (Extra Credit) for any reason, including technical issues, personal extenuating circumstances, or illness. Plan ahead and complete at least one attempt at each EP (Extra Credit) at the end of each Lesson throughout your study of the material, so you do not lose your Extra Credit opportunity due to an emergency at the end of the Module.</strong></p>\n<h3>Responsibility for Ensuring Grades are recorded on CANVAS correctly</h3>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #fbeeb8;\"><strong>Connect typically presents an average of all homework attempts but the <i>highest attempt is uploaded to the canvas gradebook.</i> Please note, the Canvas gradebook is used to maintain student scores. <i>It is a student's responsibility to check this frequently for accuracy and report any concerns to the Course Coordinator.</i></strong></span></p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

What about the environmental and social implications of the trajectory it\u2019s on. Additionally, think about some potential future developments that could come out of it and discuss an application that could be built which we don\u2019t yet see.

      "content": "<p>Hi Class,</p>\n<p>Lab 1 is available on canvas. Please check its due date.</p>\n<p>I am writing to re-emphasize the crucial instructions related to Lab1's submission (in some cases, you will find that we refer to as lab0). To begin, I assume that you have had the opportunity to view the two videos that have been posted on Canvas, namely \"Lab1Hints_old_recorded_recitation.mp4\" and an alternate version bearing a similar name. Experience has shown these video resources to be extremely valuable in familiarizing students like yourself with this tool and effectively guiding the process of producing desired outputs for Lab1. TAs will be addressing analogous procedures during the recitation sessions. Therefore, I kindly encourage you to focus your attention on the instructions provided during the recitation period.</p>\n<p>While it is encouraged; it is not obligatory to develop your own solution of the Verilog code. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Nevertheless</strong></span>, submission of the solutions of the project questions is mandatory. As part of the submission requirements, you should simulate the design and compile your responses to all the lab questions into a comprehensive report (e.g., a Word document). Subsequently, <strong>please compress the report together with the project files into a single zipped folder and proceed to upload it on canvas.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In the event that you encounter any challenges during the simulation process</strong>, you have the option of creating a new project and subsequently importing the .v (Verilog) files into that new project environment.</p>\n<p>Please note that Item 10 pertains to those students who have taken my approval to take the class as an honor option and have chosen to undertake additional work on certain labs.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to any of the TAs/LAs/myself for any further questions.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Dr. Almekkawy</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

Just like you learn and practice other tools that you\u2019ll use in the real world (programming languages, test equipment, simulation software, etc.), practicing integrity in an academic setting will help you make ethical decisions once you\u2019re in the workforce. Practice makes perfect!</p>\n<p>All engineers and scientists need to follow codes of ethics. Here are a few examples of professional codes of ethics in related fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Code of Ethics</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics\" target=\"_blank\">ACM Code of Ethics</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"instructure_file_link inline_disabled\" href=\"https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics\" target=\"_blank\">NSPE Code of Ethics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the consequences of violating academic integrity standards can be steep, the consequences of ethics violations in the workplace can be even more detrimental, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>being terminated from a job</li>\n<li>fines being levied onto individuals and/or companies</li>\n<li>legal action</li>\n<li>injury/death to users of products that were jeopardized by unethical practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many examples of lapses in ethical judgment in industry that led to lawsuits, injuries, or even death.

However, if one does not have a thorough understanding of the code/library they use, this could pose security problems. The code may contain errors or even intentional malicious backdoor traps. For example, here are <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://nightfall.ai/resources/accidental-data-leaks/\" target=\"_blank\">five common accidental sources of data leaks</a>. You must be able to properly scrutinize, vet, or modify the code you find through other resources. If you haven't properly learned the material, you could be opening yourself, and others, to harm.</p>\n<p>In an academic setting, the goal of projects/assessments is to learn. Looking up answers, or even submitting modified code/work from others after understanding what it does is not a good way to learn or a sustainable practice. Instructors may utilize existing resources as good, or bad, examples to help you learn, but you must develop a strong foundation to build on, so you are able to be competitive and innovative once you enter the workforce.</p>\n<div class=\"content-box\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n<div class=\"grid-row center-xs\">\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.05rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"What is Academic Integrity (AI)?\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361972/pages/what-is-academic-integrity-ai\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361972/pages/what-is-academic-integrity-ai\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">What is Academic Integrity?</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"Why AI is Important\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361972/pages/why-is-academic-integrity-important\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361972/pages/why-is-academic-integrity-important\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Why is AI Important?</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"Types of AI Violations\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361972/pages/types-of-ai-violations\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361972/pages/types-of-ai-violations\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Types of AI Violations</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"Consequences of an AI Violation\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361972/pages/consequences-of-an-ai-violation\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361972/pages/consequences-of-an-ai-violation\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Consequences of AI Violations</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"AI Violation Process\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361972/pages/academic-integrity-violation-process\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2361972/pages/academic-integrity-violation-process\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">AI Violation Process</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-4 col-lg-2\">\n<p><a class=\"Button Button--primary\" style=\"min-width: 80%; max-width: 90%; padding: 0.1rem; margin: 0.1rem; font-size: .9em; height: 3rem; background-color: #1e407c; color: #ffffff;\" title=\"EECS AI Quiz\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361972/quizzes/5273214?module_item_id=44186004\" data-api-endpoint=\"$CANVAS_OBJECT_REFERENCE$/quizzes/g577c7dc38efe739f891455033c7287de?module_item_id=gc01226dc9fd78266f98472c8e4dca929\" data-api-returntype=\"Page\">Take the Quiz</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",
