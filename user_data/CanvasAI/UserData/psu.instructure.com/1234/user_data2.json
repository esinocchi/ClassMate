The specific language is C, which is widely used for operating system implementations, and which forms the basis for the C++ and Java languages studied in the prerequisite courses. This will help students understand operating system services available to application programmers, and provide a firm ground for the study of operating systems in general.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This course covers the basic skills and topics that form the foundation of later CMPSC and CMPEN courses. For this reason, it is essential that every student attend and learn the material. It will be nearly impossible for students to complete later courses in these majors without mastery of this material.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Grading</span></h3>\n<p>The course will be graded on exams and course projects:</p>\n<table id=\"rounded-corner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 49.4402%; height: 530px;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 34px;\">Activity</th>\n<th style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 34px;\">Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 28px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 28px;\">Course Projects</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 28px;\">50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #1</p>\n<p>Date: 17th February</p>\n<p>Time: 8:10 PM to 10:00 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Location:&nbsp;</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #2</p>\n<p>Date: 31st March</p>\n<p>Time: <span>&nbsp;8:10 PM - 10:00 PM</span></p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 52px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 52px;\">Final Exam (time/date TBD)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 52px;\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the exams to pass the class.</li>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the class projects to pass the class.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Exam Policy: Make-Up and Conflict Exam</span></h3>\n<strong data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\"></strong>Please note the following policy regarding exams for this course:</div>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<div>Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>There will be only one conflict/Makeup exam.<br>A conflict/Make-up exam will be offered only to students with a verified scheduling conflict and health issue.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>To be eligible, students must provide appropriate documentation as proof of the conflict and other reasons.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Penalties for Missing the Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>If you cannot attend the conflict/Make-Up exam, and request another conflict/Make-Up exam,&nbsp;<br>you will get a 25% penalty on points.

Any violation of this policy will be considered cheating and will result in the student receiving an 'F' grade for the project and a full letter grade off the final grade for the course. Students with more than one violation may face stronger penalties per the university policy.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Students are forbidden from copying code, makefiles, or any other material from the Internet (such as publicly available Github repos). Plagiarism will be strictly enforced by the TAs through in-depth reviews of your submissions.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Any violation in the letter or spirit of this policy will also be considered cheating and handled as described above. Note that any publication of the assignments (e.g., via github or other system) is considered a violation of the above policy.</p>\n<p>More information on The Department of Computer Science and Engineering\u2019s Academic Integrity Standards, which are applicable to this course, can be found at<span>&nbsp;</span><a class=\"external\" href=\"https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx</a></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Lateness Policy</span></h3>\n<p>Lab assignments are assessed a 10% per day late penalty, up to a maximum of three days after which a zero grade will be given. No exceptions. Period. &nbsp;Note that the last lab will not have a three-day grace period as we need to finish the grading of this lab as soon as possible and make time for the grading of the final exam.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Virtual Machines/Student Computer</span></h3>\n<p>As part of the course projects, every student will be required to maintain a virtual machine on a personal computer. Students are responsible for administrating and maintaining these virtual machines and are strongly encouraged to back them up frequently.</p>\n<p>It is the student's responsibility to have a functioning and suitably powerful computer to run their virtual machines.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Hardware or software failures are the student's responsibility, and can not be used as an excuse for late assignments</strong></span>. The minimum requirements for this computer that has 100MB of free storage, 8GB of memory, and a 64-bit processor. Netbooks and tablets are not suitable.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Prerequisites</span></h3>\n<p>You must have completed and passed (with a grade of C or better) the prerequisite course CMPSC 221, Object-Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications, which uses Java. You must have completed and passed (C or better) the earlier courses CMPSC 131 and 132. If, instead, you have completed and passed similar courses elsewhere, contact the instructor. Prior experience with Unix or C is not expected, but you should be very familiar with the concepts introduced in CMPSC 131 and 132 and know how to use an integrated development environment, e.g., Microsoft's Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>If possible, you should take CMPEN 331, Computer Organization and Design, at the same time as this course, or within one semester of it. The connection between these courses would be stronger if we could require you to take both at the same time, but that's not possible. In 331, you learn about the basics of memory organization (registers, cache, main memory, virtual memory), instruction execution, exceptions and interrupts, and the translation of procedural programming languages into machine instructions.</p>\n<p>This is a three-credit course, and you can expect to spend a lot of time outside of class working on the project programming. To avoid turning the programming assignments into a nightmare of unsuccessful debugging, you should recognize symptoms of confusion early and promptly ask for help from the professors or TA. With the exception of first and second assignments, the following assignments will build on previous assignments, so incomplete or poor code will make later assignments very difficult if not impossible. For this reason, it is essential students do not get behind on the projects.</p>\n<p>We will often give you some code as examples or as a starter kit for an assignment, and the use of that material is encouraged. After that point, the programming work should be done on your own.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>This will be strictly enforced.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Ethics</span></h3>\n<p>This course considers topics involving systems. As part of this investigation, we will cover technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for any purpose or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class.</p>\n<p>Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating on tests, or other disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics and will result in the penalty identified above. Programming assignments must be completed without assistance or cooperation between students.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries with it similar penalties.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, please contact the course professor for advice. Do not undertake any action which could be perceived as technology misuse or cheating anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received explicit permission from Professor Suman Saha.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Disability Accommodation</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University\u2019s educational programs.

The more specific purpose is to provide students a basic understanding of the role of financial and managerial accounting information in the decisions of capital market participants external to a business enterprise (e.g., stockholders, banks, financial analysts, prospective stockholders), and in the decisions of those who manage business enterprises. Accounting information has an important role in the resource allocation process in our socioeconomic system as a whole, as well as in each individual business enterprise. This course provides students with an understanding of the nature of the accounting function, and how the information in accounting reports is used by various decision-makers in their resource allocation decisions. This course is an important background course for all business majors and numerous non-business majors.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #394b58; background: #394b58; padding: 0 1rem;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #fff; font-variant: small-caps;\"><strong> <img src=\"https://eldig.psu.edu/storyline/images/syl-faculty1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">Instructional Team</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div class=\"grid-row\" style=\"grid-gap: 5%; margin: 0; width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/kms563-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Kristy Schenck</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:kms563@psu.edu\">kms563@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/snh108-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Schalyn Sohn</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:snh108@psu.edu\">snh108@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img id=\"171435605\" src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682060/preview?verifier=YnFLamBH4JkZRJMKb86TtByip00tdgpqJ3WFKVCe\" alt=\"Curling.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682060\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Shelley Curling<br><a href=\"mailto:mlh257@psu.edu\">mlh257@psu.edu</a><br></strong></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682017/preview?verifier=FOXaFg0SSXguF2o2M0jFXC6ueLoELgEffGHPZYA0\" alt=\"instructor photo\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682017\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Course Coordinator:</span><br>Karen Trust<br></strong><a href=\"mailto:kjb322@psu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kjb322@psu.edu</a>&nbsp;<br>Karen manages the TAs.

We will use a Freeware simulator called MARS to support the required assembly language programming. This software is available for download from the following link <a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">MARS</a> \"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\", MARS itself has a nice Help feature. \u201c<a href=\"http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/\">http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/</a>\u201d.</li>\n<li>For the Verilog language, you will need to use Xilinx Vivado/ModelSim. This is available in w136 Westgate building. You can also download Vivado (<strong>It is available for windows machine and it is not available for Mac</strong>). Instructions for downloading the Vivado WebPack version can be found here: \u201c <a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html\">https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html</a><span>\u201d</span><span>.</span> Xilinx has a strict internal export control policy which blocks users from E or D category countries. Check this file for more details: <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file\">https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/regulation-docs/2255-supplement-no-1-to-part-740-country-groups-1/file</a>.</li>\n<li>Students are facing different issues while installing Vivado. So, I request everyone to complete the installation as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>It is very recommended to install Vivado as all the labs hints are using this software. However, students facing the Vivado license issue should install an alternative software called \"Intel Quartus\".</li>\n<li>This is very uncommon but just to let you know that <strong>students who are outside the United States may face difficulties with respect to Vivado webpack installation due to license issues.</strong> <strong>They can install the Intel Quartus software instead</strong>.

However, you have the permission to miss one of the homework without penalty</u></strong>. You have to solve the online problems in the zyBooks website (https://www.zybooks.com). Some of the problems will be assigned in advance of covering their corresponding materials in class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Exams</u></em></p>\n<p>There will be <strong>three</strong> midterm exams. Each student is entitled to skip one exam due to official reasons without incurring any penalties. Consequently, no makeup exam will be granted for the first missed exam. You will only be eligible for a particular makeup exam if you have missed two or more exams due to official excuses. Please be aware that if you choose to miss one exam for personal reasons, it will count towards your official number of allowable excuses mentioned earlier. It is strongly recommended not to miss any exams unless you have an official excuse. Official excuses need to be approved by the instructor in advance. Please refer to the 'Guidelines for Makeup Examinations' for further information. <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup exam unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy.</strong></p>\n<p><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></p>\n<p><em><u>Quizzes</u></em></p>\n<p>6 \u2013 9 pre-announced quizzes will be given during the semester, (<strong>no makeups,</strong> unless you have more than a defined number of official excuses), <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup quiz unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy</strong>.&nbsp; Every student will have a defined number, in advance, of excuses to use them for skipping any defined number of quizzes if needed (these can be personal or official excuses). Meaning that, I will <strong>drop</strong> the lowest defined number of scores. This defined number is currently equal to two and it could increase in the future. You must take a permission <strong>in advance</strong> from the instructor if you would like to take your quiz with another section. Cheating on any QUIZ will result in 0 grade on that QUIZ.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Labs</u></em></p>\n<p>Lab assignments will be assigned on canvas. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 2% per day, up to a maximum of 5 days (with one minute being equivalent to one day). It is advisable to adhere to timely submission and refrain from relying on the available late submission days. Your proactive approach to meeting deadlines is highly encouraged. No submission will be accepted after the 5<sup>th</sup> day of the due date. TAs or LAs (if any) will grade the submitted zipped file to canvas. Please expect that we might pick randomly some students to grade their submitted labs through one to one meeting with the grader. In this case, your answers have to match your submission and you need to show your understanding of your solution. Your GRADE will depend solely on your answers to the grader(s) questions in that particular lab. The same apply for the project stated in the next item.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em><u>Project</u></em></p>\n<p><strong>There will be one project. This project due date will be posted online, late submission will not be accepted.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Guidelines for Makeup Examinations or Delayed Assignment Submission:</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>- A self-report or standard doctor's appointment is not considered an acceptable reason or suffice as an excuse.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Evidence from an in-person visit with a healthcare practitioner, explicitly demonstrating the inability to partake in the exam/quiz as originally scheduled, is necessary.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- It must be emphasized that under these circumstances too, notifications regarding excuses have to be delivered at least 24 hours before the designated assignment due date. This is crucial as late submission requests beyond the assignment deadline or approved grace period will not be accommodated.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>-An email petition sent by a student on the day of or one day prior to the exam requesting a makeup examination does not ensure automatic acceptance by the instructor. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Unexcused absence from an examination without prior consent of the instructor will disqualify students from being allowed a makeup opportunity regardless of their situation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING:</strong></p>\n<p>Homework: 5%</p>\n<p>Labs: 20%</p>\n<p>Quizzes: 25%</p>\n<p>Exam 1: 15% (Tentative: Week of February 24<sup>th </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 2: 15% (Tentative: Week of March 31<sup>st</sup> in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 3: 15% (Tentative: Week of April 21<sup>st </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Project: 5 %</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING DISTRIBUTION: </strong></p>\n<p>A&nbsp; 100-94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+&nbsp; &lt; 90 - 86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C+&nbsp; &lt; 77 - 73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; &lt; 68 - 61</p>\n<p>A-&nbsp; &lt;94- 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 86 - 81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 73 - 68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 61 - 0</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 81-77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Engaging in academic dishonesty during any examination will result in a grade of 0 for that specific examination. <strong>Violations will be subject to academic integrity consequences, which may include failure of the course in certain instances.

Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Penn State policy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>, an academic integrity violation is \u201can intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.\u201d&nbsp;Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use&nbsp;ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not&nbsp;submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content.&nbsp;Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor&nbsp;<strong>before submitting work</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course</strong>&nbsp;unless they are cleared of wrongdoing&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean\u2019s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Appropriate behavior expectations </strong></p>\n<p><span>Sexual misconduct is never tolerated at Penn State. Prohibited conduct includes sexual and gender-based harassment, stalking, sexual assault, and dating violence. These behaviors are not allowed in the classroom, the campus community, labs, or anywhere students, staff, and faculty are located. Prohibited behaviors can include degrading comments such as belittling female-identified students, LGBTQ+ individuals, and gender-diverse students. It can also include harassment, touching someone without their consent, following someone without consent, repeated calls or messaging, physical acts of violence, and more. In other words, professional and appropriate behavior is always expected, and inappropriate or unprofessional behavior is never tolerated.

This gives you the chance to make changes to the climate system, such as increasing the solar input, and see what the effect will be on the temperature of the earth.</p>\n<p>Climate models are very powerful tools which we can use to understand the relationships between different forcings, however, they are also very complicated as they include a lot of physics. We don't expect you to memorize or understand all of the equations, they are there so that people who want to can dig deeper.

That is your job.&nbsp; Find posts that interest you<u> </u>and comment on them. My main role is to make sure the forum is courteous and supportive.<br></strong></p>\n<p>The grading system in Yellowdig is built in.&nbsp; You\u2019ll get points for posting and replying once you pass the minimum length limits and you\u2019ll get points when other students comment on your post.&nbsp; <strong>So the best way to succeed is to post Early and comment Often!&nbsp; The goal is NOT to leave working on your weekly entry till 11PM on Saturday night!&nbsp;</strong> You won\u2019t be able to get the maximum number of points for that week that way.&nbsp; Post on Monday or Tuesday and you will.</p>\n<p>One thing about Yellowdig.&nbsp; <strong>I cannot get into the system to give extensions or change points awarded.&nbsp; If you miss a deadline for any reason there is nothing I can do.</strong>&nbsp; One thing that Yellowdig does have is a buffer of 35% meaning you can exceed the 1000 points required to get an A by 350 points, so you can make up credit lost in past weeks by excelling in the current week.&nbsp; That is the only way to make up for absence or inactivity.</p>\n<p>So I encourage you to build your community in this class.&nbsp; You might make friends, you certainly will see the passion other students have for important and urgent issues facing our Earth.</p>\n<p>Have fun with Yellowdig!</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

One such past climate was the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), a time about 56 million years ago when the climate warmed rapidly. Scientists believe that studying the PETM may give us insight into current warming trends. Therefore for Module 1 Lab this week you will compare estimated ocean temperature data from the PETM with modern sea surface temperatures. The lab relies on Google Earth; if you have not already, be sure to complete the Google Earth Tutorial.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Please begin with the Practice lab (Module 1 lab 1 Submission (Practice)), it has the same type of questions you will get in the graded lab for credit. &nbsp;You can get the instructions and the key Google Earth kmz files on the Instruction page.&nbsp; <strong>Make sure you listen to my video on how to open files and do other important steps.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Once you have completed the practice, you may submit answers in Canvas. The practice lab has no time limit and unlimited attempts. It's an excellent way to verify whether or not you understand the concepts of the lab.</p><p>When you are ready, proceed to the Module 1 lab 1 Submission (Graded).&nbsp; You will have one 90-minute attempt with no retakes so that\u2019s why its good to do the practice as many times till you are ready.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Tim</p></div></div></div></div><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "message": "<p>Hi, Students:</p>\n<p>More on Yellowdig scoring.&nbsp; You get points for your initial entry and for responses to other student\u2019s entries. <strong>Your initial entry must be 75 words long to get credit</strong>. You earn more points for a great initial entry. Your peers are your judges and when they respond to your post because it interests or resonates with them, you get points. So you will be rewarded for doing great research and generating an excellent and thoughtful original post. Feel free to add images and videos to bring your post to life, but these are not essential. The main thing is that a quality post based on solid research will get you credit. Also, early entries will get more points because more students will get to respond to them before the deadline, so do not wait until the deadline to post your initial entry.</p>\n<p>I will monitor the feed and award accolades and extra points for excellent entries. This will be another good way for you to see what a good entry looks like. I can also deduct points for entries that are off subject, have errors, or are impolite or offensive. Use of AI is easily detected and will result in severe penalties.</p>\n<p>You get credit for replying to posts. <strong>Replies must be 25 words long to get credit.</strong> Please avoid single line entries like \u201cI agree with you.\u201d Make sure your entry has substance.</p>\n<p>Here is a summary of the scoring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Writing an Initial Post of at least <strong>75</strong> words (<strong><i>280 </i></strong>points) as early as possible.<br></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Writing a Comment of at least <strong>25</strong> words (<strong>210</strong> points) by Saturday midnight.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving a Comment on your Post (<strong>70 </strong>points)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving an Accolade on your Post or Comment (Points vary):</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">Receiving a Reaction on your Post or Comment (<strong>50</strong> points</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom line, you need to get 1000 points a week to get full credit in Yellowdig</strong>.&nbsp; You will learn how the scoring works as you post. Watch your score in Yellowdig and learn what you need to do to get 1000 points a week. Scores transfer to Canvas daily so you can watch there too but Yellowdig is more current.&nbsp; <strong>The score in Canvas is an average for the number of weeks so do not worry when the score drops on Sunday morning, it will rise again when you start posting.</strong></p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

      "message": "<p>Hi, Students:</p>\n<p>The goal of the Capstone Discussion is to develop engaging conversations on the theme <em>Earth in the Year 2100</em>.&nbsp; Each week we will focus on different topics related to this theme and the current module. The goal is to take what you have learned in the module and synthesize it with your own research and analysis.&nbsp; You will be required to submit an original entry every week and to reply to at least one other student's post by Saturday midnight.&nbsp; Submit your entry early to get more responses and more points. Your grade will be based on how active you are in the conversation.&nbsp; Yellowdig is used for the discussion as it offers a much better experience than traditional Canvas discussion boards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The first topics will open on Sunday related to Module 1.</strong></p>\n<p>The Capstone Discussion is a great way to gain credit lost in the quizzes and labs if you spend the time to be engaged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also have an \"I need help\" option in Yellowdig for you to get help with labs or other matters. Include @ProfessorBralower for a faster response.</p>\n<p>Please read he instructions in the Orientation and Module 1 carefully.&nbsp; You will need to make an account with a one-time payment of $12.95 for the semester. You can purchase online or at the bookstore.&nbsp; You will get the hang of the discussion in the first week and get an idea of how your activity is rewarded in points.&nbsp; The main advice I have is to post your initial entry early.&nbsp; That way it will gain more attention and possibly more points.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that Use of AI of ChatGPT in generating entries is a breach of Academic integrity and is easily detected.&nbsp; The penalties will be severe, so please make sure you always write everything in your own words</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please let me know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>Tim</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

Please note that we included the effect of this credit in your Module 1 Exam score when we uploaded the results to Canvas\u2026so your Canvas score for the Module 1 Exam already includes the effect of these additional points. Some of you may notice that your exam score exceeds 100% as a result of these additional points. Canvas treats any amount in excess of 100% as extra\u202fcredit in the course. If you are interested to review your exam, please sign-up via this link: <a href=\"https://app.smeal.psu.edu/acctg/exam-review/\">Exam Review</a></p>\n<p>We would like to remind you to make use of the \"Grade Calculator\" excel file found on the canvas page Course Grades and Grade Calculator to determine your current overall grade in the course. A reminder that Extra Credit assignments ONLY help your grade. Let's say you earn 50% on all extra credit assignments then at the end of the semester you would increase your grade by 2% i.e. possibly going from 88% to 90%. You have unlimited attempts on the Extra Credit assignments and we post the highest grade on Extra Credit assignments.\u202f&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The highest assignment grade for HW for Lesson 1 - Lesson 3 and for EC for Lesson 1 - Lesson 3 have been posted to Canvas.

Schedule a time that you KNOW you will not be late or you will risk not being able to take the exam! </em><strong>Failure to take the exam on the exam date will result in a zero on that exam.</strong></li>\n<li>Make sure you receive a confirmation email from eTesting confirming the time you selected for the exam. If you do not receive this confirmation email, then your registration was not completed correctly, and you should try again.&nbsp;<strong>There is no guarantee that you will be able to take the exam if you failed to schedule an exam time.&nbsp; Failure to take the exam on the exam date will result in a zero on that exam.</strong></li>\n<li>When you receive the confirmation email, be sure you mark your personal calendar correctly with the time you selected.</li>\n<li>If you miss your exam, you will receive a zero.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>~On behalf of your ACCTG 211 Instructional Team</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

Please check its due date.</p>\n<p>I am writing to re-emphasize the crucial instructions related to Lab1's submission (in some cases, you will find that we refer to as lab0). To begin, I assume that you have had the opportunity to view the two videos that have been posted on Canvas, namely \"Lab1Hints_old_recorded_recitation.mp4\" and an alternate version bearing a similar name. Experience has shown these video resources to be extremely valuable in familiarizing students like yourself with this tool and effectively guiding the process of producing desired outputs for Lab1. TAs will be addressing analogous procedures during the recitation sessions. Therefore, I kindly encourage you to focus your attention on the instructions provided during the recitation period.</p>\n<p>While it is encouraged; it is not obligatory to develop your own solution of the Verilog code. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Nevertheless</strong></span>, submission of the solutions of the project questions is mandatory. As part of the submission requirements, you should simulate the design and compile your responses to all the lab questions into a comprehensive report (e.g., a Word document). Subsequently, <strong>please compress the report together with the project files into a single zipped folder and proceed to upload it on canvas.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In the event that you encounter any challenges during the simulation process</strong>, you have the option of creating a new project and subsequently importing the .v (Verilog) files into that new project environment.</p>\n<p>Please note that Item 10 pertains to those students who have taken my approval to take the class as an honor option and have chosen to undertake additional work on certain labs.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to any of the TAs/LAs/myself for any further questions.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Dr. Almekkawy</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

What are the implications of these advancements and how could they benefit society? (This is an open-ended question that encourages discussion. It may require you to conduct research through various means such as the internet, library resources, and more to gather the necessary information and formulate your response).</p>\n<p>2-In our class discussion, we talked about the historical progression of computing systems. What about the environmental and social implications of the trajectory it\u2019s on. Additionally, think about some potential future developments that could come out of it and discuss an application that could be built which we don\u2019t yet see. Explain what the implications of that are in more detail.
