We will use this tool for written engagement in the course every week and it will account for a large portion of your grade. This should work seamlessly if you register and pay through the 'Packback' tab on the sidebar of this Canvas page. I am not sure how it will work if you buy through the bookstore though. If you go through the bookstore though I believe it can be paid for with financial aid. I also believe they have some scholarships available, so if the $39 feels like a lot make the ask---they are really trying to get a big PSU contract, so they want you all to be happy with the product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Purchases\"><a title=\"Home\" href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2361723\" data-course-type=\"navigation\">Detailed Course Schedule</a></h3>\n<h3>What am I going to be graded on?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Weekly written discussion via PackBack (30%) (12 Total Packback Posts)</li>\n<li><em style=\"color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">Two</em><span style=\"color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\"> (non-cumulative, online) exams on lecture content and reading assignments (20% Total - 10% each)</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\"><strong>Midterm Exam:</strong> Wednesday, March 5</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\"><strong>Final Exam:</strong> Monday, May 5</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One short speculative or science fiction writing assignment (5%)\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Due: Friday, April 18&nbsp;</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One Apocalyptic Geography Project: one 2-3 page essay<span style=\"color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;\">(Total 20%, separated into stages), and an associated, short verbal presentation on your essay (10%).

If we can't help you do that then we lose. We also want to give you a chance to structure your ideas more carefully (the independent assignments). The quizzes are relatively unimportant to discourage cheating (why bother) and downplay the importance of memorization while still giving you an incentive to do the work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Purchase\">What do I need to do to get an A?</h3>\n<p>Final grades will be assigned using the following classification:</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp; = 94-100%&nbsp; |&nbsp; A-&nbsp; = 90-93% | B+&nbsp; = 87-89% | B&nbsp;&nbsp; = 84-86% | B-&nbsp; = 80-83%</p>\n<p>C+ = 77-79%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 70-76% | D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 60-70% | F&nbsp;&nbsp; = &lt; 60%</p>\n<h3>I need an extension/ What is the policy on late assignments?</h3>\n<p>There are no extensions on the Packback assignments, but I will drop the lowest score (or you can choose to skip one). Packback is intended to work as an engagement tool. 'Engaging' after the fact isn't engaging. If you aren't allocating the time to engage with the material and your classmates during the week then you are not doing the core work of the class and your grade will reflect that. Since you can easily get full points on this assignment, there really is no excuse to not get it done.</p>\n<p>Except for Packback, if you contact the instructor (<a href=\"mailto:csfowler@psu.edu\">m</a><a href=\"mailto:ark.ortiz@psu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">ark.ortiz@psu.edu</a>) any time<span>&nbsp;</span><span>before an assignment is due</span><span>&nbsp;</span>you can have an extension. You don't need to give a reason so don't sweat it. You don't need to hear back from me to be sure the extension is granted. I will get back to you so we can agree on a revised due date, but as long as I got the email before the assignment was due you are fine. I don't want to judge the quality of excuses so I will just trust you. We can work it out.</p>\n<p>If you fail to contact the instructor before the assignment is due<span>&nbsp;</span><span>you probably* can't have an extension.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you turn in an assignment late WITHOUT getting an extension you will receive a zero on the assignment.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>That's right, if you can't be bothered to send me a quick note asking for extra time then we can't be bothered to grade your work. Just ask for the extension, I wont think any less of you I promise.</p>\n<p>*The way things are going I am no longer willing to use absolutes here, but you are really really really unlikely to get an extension.</p>\n<h3>Can I cheat?</h3>\n<p>No, of course not. See the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2329068/assignments/syllabus#Academic%20Integrity\">text below</a><span>&nbsp;</span>on Academic Integrity. Something to particularly watch out for is using another person's words in the written assignments you turn in and in your questions and responses on Packback. I take these things seriously and will 1) Give you a zero on the assignment, and 2) Report you to the Dean's office for further action.</p>\n<p>Some people copy and paste off the internet to avoid doing the work or just get AI to do their essay for them so they don't have to. These people are cheating and they know it. I have zero respect for people who are paying for an education but don't want to take the time to think about things--if this is you, you have lost the plot and need to rethink your goals in life. If you are honestly confused by the idea that taking other people's words and using them as your own or just having a chatbot write for you is cheating then I strongly suggest you come to office hours early in the term and I will walk you through it.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem comes from people who are not trying to cheat, but are sloppy with their notes (writing down a quote from something they read but not putting it in quotes and then using the exact text in a paper later). A lot of these folks aren't trying to cheat, but it still counts as plagiarism. Here is a basic, foolproof rule to guide you:<span>&nbsp;</span><span>If an idea comes from a source, cite that source. If the words and idea come from a source put the words in quotes and cite the source. That is the rule. If you break that rule it is plagiarism.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>The good news is that using quotes and citations really impresses the grader, so the better you are at using these words and ideas properly the better you will do on the assignment. There is no reason to take someone else's ideas and not credit them.</p>\n<p>After I say this I always get questions about what citation style to use. I have never understood why anyone cares. As long as it credits the author, gives the date the idea was published and provides enough information for me to get the source from the internet or a library I am good. For the sake of avoiding follow up questions from those who REALLY want an answer, APA.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Packback\"><span>Packback Questions</span></h3>\n<p><span>Participation is a requirement for this course, and the Packback Questions platform will be used for online discussion about class topics. Packback will be 30% of your grade, a high number, please be cognizant that this is because we think that asking questions about the material and trying to engage on those questions with your classmates is absolutely the most important thing you can do to learn the material.<br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Packback Requirements:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Your participation on Packback will count toward 30% of your overall course grade.</span></p>\n<p><span>There will be a weekly Thursday 11:59 PM EST deadline for submitting a question.<br></span></p>\n<p><span>There will be a Weekly Sunday at 11:59PM EST deadline for submitting two responses to questions raised by your classmates.</span></p>\n<p><span>In order to receive your points per week, you should submit the following each week:</span></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span>1 open-ended Question per week with a minimum Curiosity Score of 70, each worth 3pts of each assignment grade</p>\n<p>2 Responses per week with a minimum Curiosity Score of 70, each worth 1pt of each assignment grade</p>\n<p>In past semesters students have run into problems where their post didn't go through because the curiosity score wasn't high enough or because it was moderated for content. Just keep an eye on things to make sure it is working properly for you and don't wait until the last minute to draw attention to problems. Also, there is an issue where people access Packback NOT through the link on Canvas. These people can see that their posts are going through and getting scored, but they don't show up as graded. I can fix this, but it is a lot of work. Just check the Gradebook after the first couple weeks to make sure things are working out.</p>\n<h4><span>How to Register on Packback:</span></h4>\n<p>Note: Only access Packback through Canvas<strong></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in order to ensure your grades sync properly</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the Packback menu heading on the left side of the Canvas Page</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions on your screen to finish your registration.</li>\n<li><strong>In order for your grade to be visible in Canvas</strong>, make sure to access Packback through Canvas, not directly through the packback web site</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How to Get Help from the Packback Team:</h4>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about Packback throughout the semester, please read their FAQ at<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://help.packback.co/\" target=\"_blank\">help.packback.co<span class=\"external_link_icon\" role=\"presentation\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>.

There will also be activities designed to introduce you to the learning objectives and to help answer questions that you may have about them.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Using those definitions, here are the class activities and their purposes:</span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 259px;\" border=\"1\" width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 27px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 27px;\" scope=\"col\">Activity</th>\n<th style=\"height: 27px;\" scope=\"col\">Primary Goals</th>\n<th style=\"height: 27px;\" scope=\"col\">Notes</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Reading</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Introduction</strong>: concepts, problem solving</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Pre-Class Expert TA Assignments</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Formative</strong>: concepts, problem solving</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">\"Tests\" material BEFORE class</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Lecture&nbsp;</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Formative</strong>: concepts, problem solving, class participation questions</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Recitation</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Introduction</strong>: group skills;<strong> Formative &amp; Summative</strong>: concepts, problem solving, group skills</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Lab</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Introduction</strong>: experimental skills<strong>; Formative &amp; Summative</strong>: concepts, problem solving, experimental skills, group skills</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Post-Class Expert TA Assignments</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Summative</strong>: concepts, problem solving</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Try doing this closed book</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Midterm Exams</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Summative</strong>: concepts, problem solving, experimental skills</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Primarily focused on previous material</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 29px;\">\n<th style=\"height: 29px;\" scope=\"row\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Final Exam</span></th>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Summative</strong>: concepts, problem solving, experimental skills</span></td>\n<td style=\"height: 29px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Broadly covers all class material</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\"><span class=\"normalSpan\"><strong>Lecture/TopHat</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You must attend the \"lecture\" section for which you are registered (Top Hat participation in a lecture you are not registered for will not be counted for a grade). Your \"lecture\" section is the PHYS 211 section number which is not followed by a letter. During \"lecture\" class sessions you will have the opportunity to ask questions about the reading and will get practice answering conceptual questions (using Top Hat) and solving problems. Participation during class is not only expected but is also crucial for learning the material. Make sure you are using the WiFi and not Data in the classroom for TopHat to work best.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Laboratories</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Laboratory sections meet for about 2 hours once a week in 312 or 306 Osmond. Your meeting time is determined by your section; your Laboratory section is the&nbsp; PHYS 211 section number which is followed by an \"L.\" You must attend the laboratory section in which you are registered \u2014 no switching is permitted. Please remember to sign the sign-in sheet to assure your attendance is marked.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the lab session, your group will prepare a single write-up, addressing specific points of the experiments. Grading is based on participation, clear communication (quality explanations, clear graphs etc), and physics content. This write-up must be submitted with all group participants names on Canvas before the end of the laboratory session. If you do not help/participate you will not get the same grade. Make sure your work is represented in the document. For clarity also upload a text submission to canvas stating the names of your lab partners for each lab you attend.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Recitation</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Recitation sections meet once a week for 50 minutes. Your meeting time is determined by your section; your Recitation section is the PHYS 211 section number which is followed by an \"R.\" You must attend the recitation section in which you are registered \u2013 NO switching is permitted.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In these sections you will work collaboratively in three-member groups to complete problem-solving exercises. These problem solving activities are an invaluable component of learning physics, and will provide you with much more opportunity to explore problem solving techniques than you will have in class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The recitation activities are available in the Recitations page in Canvas. Each group must begin with a blank copy of the activity and complete it during the class period. While only one paper is turned in via Canvas upload, every student should bring an individual copy of the pertinent activity to the recitation section to have later for study purposes. Alternatively, keep an electronic copy for your reference. <span>This write-up must be submitted&nbsp; with all&nbsp; group participants names on Canvas at the end of class (within 15 minutes). If you do not help/participate you will not get the same grade. Make sure your work is represented in the document.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At each recitation session it is the responsibility of each student to write their own name on the recitation document to be handed in for credit and to write their initials on the the attendance sign-in sheet.&nbsp; We also highly recommend you leave a submission in Canvas assignment with your partner's names.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span>The&nbsp;</span><strong>recitation and labs<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>will be graded for participation and communication (100 points), and correctness (50 points). There are three roles for recitations: Recorder, Leader, and Checker. The Recorder writes on the paper - this job must rotate. Leader makes sure everyone contributing and leads discussion. Checker asks the TA questions and double checks the answers. You are expected to work on the recitation and labs the entire class time, and thus won't be penalized for incomplete activities if time runs out. Likewise you should aim to be on time as tardiness may prevent you from entering the classroom and is not a valid reason for a makeup.</span></span></p>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><strong>Weekly Expert TA problem sets</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There will typically be three Expert TA (<a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://login.theexpertta.com/Login.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://login.theexpertta.com/Login.aspx</a>) problem set assignments per week, two \"pre-class\" assignments (covering the required reading) due at 11:59pm on the night before each lecture (Sunday and Thursday) and one \"post-class\" assignment due. The due date and time for each Expert TA assignment appears in Canvas and Expert TA.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This system allows you to submit your homework at any time. Your grade on each assignment will be available immediately and, in most cases, you will have multiple tries to arrive at the correct answer. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> Students are encouraged to work together and collaborate on problem set assignments. Work submitted for individual assessment must be the work of the individual student.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>An important note about the difficulty and type of problems</strong>:&nbsp; Post-class problems are designed to test your problem solving abilities, and in particular to assess your ability to solve <em>hard</em> problems. Similarly, recitation questions are structured to build upon each other, going into greater depth in a single topic (but with more \"scaffolding\" -- helpful hints). Thus questions on these assignments of a type that cannot be tested during the time-limited multiple choice midterm and final exams. This means that when compared to each other, although covering similar concepts and skills, these questions, and exam questions (and class participation questions) will <strong>not</strong> all look the same. We will provide sample exams which have qualitatively similar questions to the kinds of questions you should expect on your midterms. However, most midterm questions you will never have seen on any other assignment in the class. Being able to answer \"new\" questions (covering concepts and requiring skills that you have developed on formative assessments throughout the class) is a fundamental learning objective for the course.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3><a id=\"exams\" name=\"exams\"></a>Exam Policy</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There will be three Midterm exams and a Final exam. Exams will be closed book. Relevant physical constants and formulae will be provided. Calculators are allowed. Cell phones, any other communication devices, tablet computers, and organizers, and additional paper are not allowed.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The exams will be based on the assigned reading in the textbook, the material covered in lecture, the recitations, the laboratories, and the homework assignments. The majority of each exam, including the final, will cover most recent material, however physics is highly cumulative so some concepts and techniques will naturally be tested on multiple exams. Please see the Course Content Objectives and the Exam pages from the Home page in Canvas for more information about the content assessed on the exams in this course.</span></div>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3><a id=\"makeup\"></a>Makeup and Excuse Policy</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><strong>Examinations</strong></p>\n<p>All students should plan to take their exams at the scheduled times. However, in the event of a conflict between an exam and a University activity, students may request a Conflict Exam as discussed below. <span><strong>Students that are physically unable (e.g. due to illness or weather conditions) to take the exam at the regularly scheduled time should not attempt to take the exam</strong> (once an examination is taken, its result is final); those students may request a Makeup Exam as discussed below.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conflict Exams</span>: Conflict exams will be offered for valid reasons as per Penn State policy 44-35) conflict exams are to be requested by completing the form on the appropriate exam page in Canvas. Students can request Conflict Exams for Midterms by&nbsp; emailing Prof. Drew (<a href=\"mailto:krp15@psu.edU\" target=\"_blank\">krp15@psu.edu)</a> only if a student is unable to schedule an exam during the allotted time period.&nbsp; Midterm Exam makeups will be computer-based exams taken in the Pollock Testing Center and must be scheduled with the course administrator. Students are not to self-enroll in an exam at the Pollock Testing Center. Students must request Conflict Exams for the Final by using the Registrar's form; late requests cannot be accommodated.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Makeup Exams</span><em>:</em><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>In the case of sudden or unexpected events that will cause them to miss an exam, students are required to notify the course instructor prior to the exam or as soon as is reasonably possible. Students that are physically unable (e.g. due to illness) to take the exam at the regularly scheduled time should not attempt to take the exam (once an examination is taken, its result is final). Makeup Exams should be taken no later than three business days after being able to return to classwork; students that do not take the exam within a reasonable time frame may receive a zero for the exam. Barring emergencies, only one makeup opportunity is granted for each exam. Midterm Exam makeups will be computer-based exams taken in the Pollock Testing Center and must be scheduled with the course administrator. Students are not to self-enroll in an exam at the Pollock Testing Center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong>Laboratory and Recitation</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The laboratory and recitation components of this course are structured around collaborative learning. You must be present in laboratory or recitation to do these assignments. Up to three (3) activities (labs and/or recitations) may be made up for a student throughout the entire course for University-approved reasons. More than three absences from activities at their regular times will interfere excessively with student learning. In extreme circumstances in which a student has four or more absences to be made up, he or she must contact the course administrator directly to discuss the situation as soon as possible. If you are absent from a laboratory or recitation section with a valid excuse, as described under \"Valid Excuse Policy\", <strong>fill out the Makeup Request form in Canvas within one week of the absence</strong>.&nbsp; Your score for the missed activity will be recorded as a zero until the activity is made up. If you are absent without a valid excuse, a score of zero will be recorded for that assignment. If a student is more than ten minutes late to a recitation or lab, leaves before their group is done, or is gone for more than ten minutes during the activity they cannot receive any credit for that period and this is NOT a valid excuse to request a makeup; if you would be late due to a reason that is a University approved reason (e.g. illness), you may request a makeup activity. </span></div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Expert TA</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You must complete the Problem sets as scheduled. They are available early so no excuses are accepted. Even technical glitches are not valid excuses. Importantly, that means please don't try to submit at 11:58PM for an 11:59PM deadline, as occasionally internet connections may lag. As mentioned above there is a window available for partial credit of Expert TA assignments. Because problem sets are available at least a week before the due date and can be done in advance, <strong>NO excuses are allowed.</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<strong></strong></div>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\"><span class=\"normalSpan\"><strong>Valid Excuse Policy</strong></span></div>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\">There are several valid reasons for missing course activities (labs &amp; recitations or exams). All other reasons are not valid (including travel):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Illness (please don't come to lab/recitation/exam if you are sick!)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Family emergencies, including a death in the immediate family, death of a close friend, sudden hospitalization of a close family member, and events of similar gravity</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities; to obtain a makeup, a student needs to obtain a letter (or a class absence form) from the unit or department sponsoring the activity. The letter must indicate the anticipated absence dates, and it must be emailed to the course administrator before the first absence.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Religious holidays (must be submitted in advance)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><i>&nbsp;Missing a laboratory or recitation due to an examination in another course is not considered a valid excuse.

In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"normalDiv\">If there is a 2 hour delay:\n<ul>\n<li class=\"normalDiv\">on a Monday or Friday, all lectures will be cancelled and an announcement will be made on how you will still be able to learn the missed material</li>\n<li class=\"normalDiv\">and your lab or recitation is cancelled, look to Canvas for instructions for make-up opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If class is cancelled for an entire day:\n<ul>\n<li>Again look to Canvas for instructions on how to proceed with learning the material from that day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<h3><a id=\"integrity\" name=\"integrity\"></a>Academic Integrity</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University\u2019s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students\u2019 dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Simply put, don't cheat, don't share your work, don't ask others to do work for you (online or in person) and don't plagiarize. If you think you are doing something wrong, you probably are. We take academic integrity very seriously. There are many ways to get help in this course and we hope you do contact any member of the instructional team if you feel unsure about the material and worry about your grade. Our goal is for you to learn the material and succeed in the course. Everyone can get an A and we are ready to help any students that struggle.&nbsp; Specifically, using online resources like Chat GTP, generative AI, or Chegg, UnstuckAI, etc to help you with classwork (especially during class) could be an academic integrity violation and could result in a negative impact to your grade. All labs, recitation, lecture notes, homework, are subject to copywrite and uploading/sharing this content without the university's consent is subject to copywrite violation laws as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In exchange for your hard work, participation and academic integrity we promise to create the best learning environments that we can and to help you as much as we can. There will be many opportunities for help and we are fair to all students. Collaborations and discussions among the students are strongly encouraged (they help learning) but we expect your best efforts to individually learn the material and we expect honesty and academic integrity in all aspects of the course.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3><a id=\"disability\" name=\"disability\"></a>Disability Policy</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs.

As a reminder, for your project, your task is to choose an event, video game, film, book, song, or other piece of media and analyze its apocalyptic geography in 2-3 pages. You will also deliver a verbal presentation of your project using a single slide during your recitation section later in the semester. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At this stage, we want you to consider the following questions as you brainstorm a topic and begin to connect the dots of your paper: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What kind of apocalypse(s) are you interested in?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Is there a particular event, story, video game, show, film, song, or other piece of media you would like to focus on for your project?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What do you think your choice of apocalypse story \u2018unveils\u2019 or reveals about ethics, institutions, and/or society?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Given what you\u2019re learning about geographic concepts (e.g., scale, relation, space, place etc.), what is </span><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">one </span></strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">geographic idea&nbsp;that you think is relevant to your apocalypse of choice?
