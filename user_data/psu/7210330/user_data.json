Can we hide, or should we learn to live with the \nhazards around us? This course will explore the causes, effects, and societal response to \ndisasters. To help us identify the key questions we need to understand to be better prepared for \nfuture disasters, we can use a combination of Hollywood disaster representations with actual \nexamples of recent major events to see what is of most relevance. With these examples (both real \nand imagined) we will focus on understanding the underlying causes of, the societal \nconsequences of, and effective means to communicate what we know about major Natural \nDisasters.\nTo accomplish this, the course is built around a range of \u2018events\u2019 both real and \u2018hollywood\u2019. For \nmost topics we will use a combination of excerpts from Hollywood  movies, parts of scientific \ndocumentaries (Nova, weather.com, etc.), mini-lectures, and in-class activities to explore what \nreally happens, why it happens, and what can we do to be better prepared. There are no exams \nin the course, and as you will see below in the discussion of grading, your grades will be based \non participation and performance on in-class activities, 5-6 short written exercises (tailored to \ncommunicate to different target audiences and communities), and a Final Project (which can be \ndone in small groups) on a topic and style of your choice. At the heart of all of this is your \nparticipation.\nText: \t\nThere is NO TEXT for this course. You will be provided (or assigned) some readings \nfrom the web or other sources. Mini-lectures in class will help provide background materials for \nthe topics.\nCourse Grading:\t\t\t\nProject Reports (~ 4-5 reports)\t\n50%\t\t\t\nCourse Participation \t\t\t\n30%\t\t\t\t\t\t\n(including in-class activities and \t\t\t\nattendance/engagement)\t\t\t\nFinal Term Project\t\t\t\n20%\t\t\n   \nEarth 101\t\nNatural Disasters: Hollywood vs Reality\t\nPage 1\n\nText from page 2:\nSpring 2024\nEarth 101 Natural Disasters: Hollywood vs Reality\nCourse Schedule (subject to modification)\nNOTE on Course Participation and Assignments: \nThis course involves substantial hands-on in-class activities that we build on to develop the \nbackground and expertise on each topic covered. These activities and the related materials are \ncovered in-class. In addition much of this work is done collaboratively with others in the class. \nTherefore you need to be able to attend class in order to successfully complete the course.\nWe recognize that unexpected illness or emergencies or PSU related activities may arise that \npreclude attending a class. In such cases you need to alert us that you will be missing class - a \nlocation to register that will be on the course Canvas site. Excessive non-attendence will result in \nloss of course participation points for the grade.\nMissed in-class activities can be made up (for full credit) within 1-week of their use in class. \nThis can be done during office hours or through other arrangements with the TA. Beyond 1-\nweek, in-class activities can be done  but for reduced credit. If there are special circumstances, \nthat preclude completing the activity within 1-week can be discussed.\nReports and other Course Assignments that are turned in past the announced Due Date will \ngenerally receive a grade reduction.\nPolicy on Academic Integrity: \nAll students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity in their \ncoursework. In particular occurrences of plagiarism or other forms of cheating will not be \ntolerated. For this course, in which collaboration and group work is encouraged it is sometimes \nconfusing as to where is the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable practices. As a \ngeneral rule it is not appropriate to present work of others as your own. If you have worked \njointly on an exercise or project it is important to identify each person\u2019s contribution. If the work \nis truly collaborative that should be so indicated. If you have questions about what constitutes \nplagiarism, I encourage you to check out the following web site, which provides a discussion of \nthe topic and examples of acceptable and unacceptable practices:\nhttp://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/lls/students/plagiarism_and_you.html\nhttp://tlt.psu.edu/plagiarism/student-tutorial\nPenn State has a variety of sites discussing academic integrity, the one below indicates both the \nUniversity and EMS policies\nwww.ems.psu.edu/current_undergrad_students/academics/integrity_policy\nAccommodations for students with disabilities \nEarth 101\t\nNatural Disasters: Hollywood vs Reality\t\nPage 2\n\nText from page 3:\nThe Office of Disability Services (http://equity.psu.edu/ods/) requests and maintains \ndisability-related documents; certifies eligibility for services; determines academic adjustments, \nauxiliary aids, and/or services; and develops plans for the provision of academic adjustments, \nauxiliary aids, and/or services as mandated under Title II of the ADA Amendments Act \n(ADAAA) of 2008 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  A list of these services is \nprovided at http://equity.psu.edu/ods/current-students. \nCampus emergencies, including weather delays, are announced on Penn State Live (http://\nlive.psu.edu/) and communicated to cellphones, email, the Penn State Facebook page, and \nTwitter via PSUTXT (to sign up, please see http://live.psu.edu/psutxt).\u00a0\nEarth 101\t\nNatural Disasters: Hollywood vs Reality\t\nPage 3\n\nText from page 4:\nCourse Topics and Schedule: \nWeek\nDates\nTopic\n1\nJan 14/16\nCourse Intro/ Overview\nVolcano\n2\nJan 21/23\nVolcano\n3\nJan 28/30\nVolcano \n4\nFeb 4/6\nEarthquakes\n5\nFeb 11/13\nEarthquakes\n6\nFeb 18/20\nEarthquakes/Tsunami\n7\nFeb 25/27\nTsunami\n8\nMar 4/6\nTsunami\nMar 10-14\nSpring Break\n9\nMar 18/20\nHurricanes\n10\nMar 25/27\nHurricanes\n11\nApr 1/3\nHurricanes/Tornado\n12\nApr 8/10\nFlooding\n13\nApr 15/17\nSea Level Rise - Flooding\n14\nApr 22/24\nGlobal Change\n15\nApr 29/May 1\nTerm Projects Due \nEarth 101\t\nNatural Disasters: Hollywood vs Reality\t\nPage 4\n\n\n\n\nText from Earth 101 Syllabus Details-2.pdf:\nText from page 1:\nEarth 101 - Natural Disasters: Hollywood vs Reality\nSpring, 2022\nAdditional Syllabus Details\nAcademic Integrity\nStudents in this class are expected to write their reports individually, in their own \nwords using proper citations.  Class members may work on the activities in \ngroups, but do not include any students not present on the worksheet.  Students \nare not to copy problem answers from another person's paper and present them as \ntheir own; students may not plagiarize text from papers or websites written by \nothers.  Students who present other people's work as their own will receive at least \na 0 on the assignment and may well receive an F or XF in the course.  Please see: \nEarth and Mineral Sciences Academic Integrity Procedures: https://\nwww.ems.psu.edu/undergraduate/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-\nundergraduates, which this course adopts. To learn more, see Penn State's \"Academic \nIntegrity Training for Students.\"\nCourse Copyright\nAll course materials students receive or have online access to are protected by \ncopyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own \nuse as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without \nthe instructor\u2019s express permission is strictly prohibited. University Policy AD 40, \nthe University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services \naddresses this issue. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of \ncopyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University\u2019s Code of Conduct, \nand/or liable under Federal and State laws.\nFor example, uploading completed labs, homework, or other assignments to any \nstudy site constitutes a violation of this policy.\nAccommodations for Students with Disabilities\nPenn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational \nprograms. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. The \nStudent Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every \nPenn State campus: (http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/disability-\ncoordinator). For further information, please visit the Student Disability Resources \nwebsite (http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources).\nIn order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact \nthe appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially \nenrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: http://\nAdditional Information - Earth 101\n\nText from page 2:\nequity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services. If the \ndocumentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your \ncampus\u2019s disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. \nPlease share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with \nthem as early in your courses as possible. You must follow this process for every \nsemester that you request accommodations.\nAttendance \nRegular attendance is critical for building the skills and knowledge developed \nthroughout the class. Students who participate have a more complete understanding \nof the material presented and are more likely to succeed in the class.  The University \nrecognizes that, on exceptional occasions, students may miss a class meeting to \nparticipate in a regularly scheduled university-approved curricular or \nextracurricular activity (such as field trips, debate trips, choir trips, and athletic \ncontests), or due to unavoidable or other legitimate circumstances such as illness, \ninjury, military service, family emergency, religious observance, participation in \nlocal, state, and federal government elections, or post-graduate, career-related \ninterviews when there is no opportunity for students to re-schedule these \nopportunities (such as elections or employment and graduate school final \ninterviews).  \nIn all cases, you should inform me in advance, when possible. Missing class, even for \na legitimate purpose, may mean there is work that cannot be made up, hurting your \ngrade in this class.  Students who encounter serious family, health, or personal \nsituations that result in extended absences should contact the Office of the Assistant \nVice President for Student Affairs (AVPSA) and Student Care and Advocacy for help: \n http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/studentcare.  You should be prepared to provide \ndocumentation for participation in University-approved activities, as well as for \ncareer-related interviews.  You should submit to the instructor a Class Absence \nForm: https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/class_absence_v3.pdf, at least one week \nprior to the activity.\n \nChange in Normal Campus Operations\nCampus emergencies, including weather delays and closures, are announced on \nPenn State News and communicated to cell phones, email, the Penn State Facebook \npage, and Twitter via PSUAlert (Sign up at: https://psualert.psu.edu/psualert/).\nReporting Educational Equity Concerns\nPenn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for \nstudents, faculty, and staff.  Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to \nage, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious \nbelief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated (https://\nAdditional Information - Earth 101\n\nText from page 3:\npolicy.psu.edu/policies/ad29) and can be reported through Educational Equity via \nthe Report Bias webpage.\nCounseling and Psychological Services \nMany students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs \nthat may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional \nwellbeing.  The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you \nthrough difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis \nintervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings.  These \nservices are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy \nrespectful of clients\u2019 cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences \nin race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

This should work seamlessly if you register and pay through the 'Packback' tab on the sidebar of this Canvas page. I am not sure how it will work if you buy through the bookstore though. If you go through the bookstore though I believe it can be paid for with financial aid.

If we can't help you do that then we lose. We also want to give you a chance to structure your ideas more carefully (the independent assignments). The quizzes are relatively unimportant to discourage cheating (why bother) and downplay the importance of memorization while still giving you an incentive to do the work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Purchase\">What do I need to do to get an A?</h3>\n<p>Final grades will be assigned using the following classification:</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp; = 94-100%&nbsp; |&nbsp; A-&nbsp; = 90-93% | B+&nbsp; = 87-89% | B&nbsp;&nbsp; = 84-86% | B-&nbsp; = 80-83%</p>\n<p>C+ = 77-79%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 70-76% | D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 60-70% | F&nbsp;&nbsp; = &lt; 60%</p>\n<h3>I need an extension/ What is the policy on late assignments?</h3>\n<p>There are no extensions on the Packback assignments, but I will drop the lowest score (or you can choose to skip one). Packback is intended to work as an engagement tool. 'Engaging' after the fact isn't engaging. If you aren't allocating the time to engage with the material and your classmates during the week then you are not doing the core work of the class and your grade will reflect that. Since you can easily get full points on this assignment, there really is no excuse to not get it done.</p>\n<p>Except for Packback, if you contact the instructor (<a href=\"mailto:csfowler@psu.edu\">m</a><a href=\"mailto:ark.ortiz@psu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">ark.ortiz@psu.edu</a>) any time<span>&nbsp;</span><span>before an assignment is due</span><span>&nbsp;</span>you can have an extension. You don't need to give a reason so don't sweat it. You don't need to hear back from me to be sure the extension is granted. I will get back to you so we can agree on a revised due date, but as long as I got the email before the assignment was due you are fine. I don't want to judge the quality of excuses so I will just trust you. We can work it out.</p>\n<p>If you fail to contact the instructor before the assignment is due<span>&nbsp;</span><span>you probably* can't have an extension.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you turn in an assignment late WITHOUT getting an extension you will receive a zero on the assignment.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>That's right, if you can't be bothered to send me a quick note asking for extra time then we can't be bothered to grade your work. Just ask for the extension, I wont think any less of you I promise.</p>\n<p>*The way things are going I am no longer willing to use absolutes here, but you are really really really unlikely to get an extension.</p>\n<h3>Can I cheat?</h3>\n<p>No, of course not. See the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2329068/assignments/syllabus#Academic%20Integrity\">text below</a><span>&nbsp;</span>on Academic Integrity. Something to particularly watch out for is using another person's words in the written assignments you turn in and in your questions and responses on Packback. I take these things seriously and will 1) Give you a zero on the assignment, and 2) Report you to the Dean's office for further action.</p>\n<p>Some people copy and paste off the internet to avoid doing the work or just get AI to do their essay for them so they don't have to. These people are cheating and they know it. I have zero respect for people who are paying for an education but don't want to take the time to think about things--if this is you, you have lost the plot and need to rethink your goals in life. If you are honestly confused by the idea that taking other people's words and using them as your own or just having a chatbot write for you is cheating then I strongly suggest you come to office hours early in the term and I will walk you through it.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem comes from people who are not trying to cheat, but are sloppy with their notes (writing down a quote from something they read but not putting it in quotes and then using the exact text in a paper later). A lot of these folks aren't trying to cheat, but it still counts as plagiarism. Here is a basic, foolproof rule to guide you:<span>&nbsp;</span><span>If an idea comes from a source, cite that source. If the words and idea come from a source put the words in quotes and cite the source. That is the rule. If you break that rule it is plagiarism.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>The good news is that using quotes and citations really impresses the grader, so the better you are at using these words and ideas properly the better you will do on the assignment. There is no reason to take someone else's ideas and not credit them.</p>\n<p>After I say this I always get questions about what citation style to use. I have never understood why anyone cares. As long as it credits the author, gives the date the idea was published and provides enough information for me to get the source from the internet or a library I am good. For the sake of avoiding follow up questions from those who REALLY want an answer, APA.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Packback\"><span>Packback Questions</span></h3>\n<p><span>Participation is a requirement for this course, and the Packback Questions platform will be used for online discussion about class topics.

Just keep an eye on things to make sure it is working properly for you and don't wait until the last minute to draw attention to problems. Also, there is an issue where people access Packback NOT through the link on Canvas. These people can see that their posts are going through and getting scored, but they don't show up as graded. I can fix this, but it is a lot of work. Just check the Gradebook after the first couple weeks to make sure things are working out.</p>\n<h4><span>How to Register on Packback:</span></h4>\n<p>Note: Only access Packback through Canvas<strong></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in order to ensure your grades sync properly</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click the Packback menu heading on the left side of the Canvas Page</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions on your screen to finish your registration.</li>\n<li><strong>In order for your grade to be visible in Canvas</strong>, make sure to access Packback through Canvas, not directly through the packback web site</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How to Get Help from the Packback Team:</h4>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about Packback throughout the semester, please read their FAQ at<span>&nbsp;</span><span><a class=\"external\" href=\"http://help.packback.co/\" target=\"_blank\">help.packback.co<span class=\"external_link_icon\" role=\"presentation\"><span class=\"screenreader-only\">Links to an external site.</span></span></a>.

These problem solving activities are an invaluable component of learning physics, and will provide you with much more opportunity to explore problem solving techniques than you will have in class.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The recitation activities are available in the Recitations page in Canvas. Each group must begin with a blank copy of the activity and complete it during the class period. While only one paper is turned in via Canvas upload, every student should bring an individual copy of the pertinent activity to the recitation section to have later for study purposes. Alternatively, keep an electronic copy for your reference. <span>This write-up must be submitted&nbsp; with all&nbsp; group participants names on Canvas at the end of class (within 15 minutes). If you do not help/participate you will not get the same grade. Make sure your work is represented in the document.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">At each recitation session it is the responsibility of each student to write their own name on the recitation document to be handed in for credit and to write their initials on the the attendance sign-in sheet.&nbsp; We also highly recommend you leave a submission in Canvas assignment with your partner's names.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span>The&nbsp;</span><strong>recitation and labs<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>will be graded for participation and communication (100 points), and correctness (50 points). There are three roles for recitations: Recorder, Leader, and Checker. The Recorder writes on the paper - this job must rotate. Leader makes sure everyone contributing and leads discussion. Checker asks the TA questions and double checks the answers. You are expected to work on the recitation and labs the entire class time, and thus won't be penalized for incomplete activities if time runs out. Likewise you should aim to be on time as tardiness may prevent you from entering the classroom and is not a valid reason for a makeup.</span></span></p>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><strong>Weekly Expert TA problem sets</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There will typically be three Expert TA (<a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://login.theexpertta.com/Login.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">https://login.theexpertta.com/Login.aspx</a>) problem set assignments per week, two \"pre-class\" assignments (covering the required reading) due at 11:59pm on the night before each lecture (Sunday and Thursday) and one \"post-class\" assignment due. The due date and time for each Expert TA assignment appears in Canvas and Expert TA.</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This system allows you to submit your homework at any time. Your grade on each assignment will be available immediately and, in most cases, you will have multiple tries to arrive at the correct answer. </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> Students are encouraged to work together and collaborate on problem set assignments. Work submitted for individual assessment must be the work of the individual student.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>An important note about the difficulty and type of problems</strong>:&nbsp; Post-class problems are designed to test your problem solving abilities, and in particular to assess your ability to solve <em>hard</em> problems. Similarly, recitation questions are structured to build upon each other, going into greater depth in a single topic (but with more \"scaffolding\" -- helpful hints). Thus questions on these assignments of a type that cannot be tested during the time-limited multiple choice midterm and final exams. This means that when compared to each other, although covering similar concepts and skills, these questions, and exam questions (and class participation questions) will <strong>not</strong> all look the same. We will provide sample exams which have qualitatively similar questions to the kinds of questions you should expect on your midterms. However, most midterm questions you will never have seen on any other assignment in the class. Being able to answer \"new\" questions (covering concepts and requiring skills that you have developed on formative assessments throughout the class) is a fundamental learning objective for the course.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3><a id=\"exams\" name=\"exams\"></a>Exam Policy</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">There will be three Midterm exams and a Final exam. Exams will be closed book. Relevant physical constants and formulae will be provided. Calculators are allowed. Cell phones, any other communication devices, tablet computers, and organizers, and additional paper are not allowed.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The exams will be based on the assigned reading in the textbook, the material covered in lecture, the recitations, the laboratories, and the homework assignments. The majority of each exam, including the final, will cover most recent material, however physics is highly cumulative so some concepts and techniques will naturally be tested on multiple exams. Please see the Course Content Objectives and the Exam pages from the Home page in Canvas for more information about the content assessed on the exams in this course.</span></div>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3><a id=\"makeup\"></a>Makeup and Excuse Policy</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><strong>Examinations</strong></p>\n<p>All students should plan to take their exams at the scheduled times. However, in the event of a conflict between an exam and a University activity, students may request a Conflict Exam as discussed below. <span><strong>Students that are physically unable (e.g. due to illness or weather conditions) to take the exam at the regularly scheduled time should not attempt to take the exam</strong> (once an examination is taken, its result is final); those students may request a Makeup Exam as discussed below.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conflict Exams</span>: Conflict exams will be offered for valid reasons as per Penn State policy 44-35) conflict exams are to be requested by completing the form on the appropriate exam page in Canvas. Students can request Conflict Exams for Midterms by&nbsp; emailing Prof. Drew (<a href=\"mailto:krp15@psu.edU\" target=\"_blank\">krp15@psu.edu)</a> only if a student is unable to schedule an exam during the allotted time period.&nbsp; Midterm Exam makeups will be computer-based exams taken in the Pollock Testing Center and must be scheduled with the course administrator. Students are not to self-enroll in an exam at the Pollock Testing Center. Students must request Conflict Exams for the Final by using the Registrar's form; late requests cannot be accommodated.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Makeup Exams</span><em>:</em><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em>In the case of sudden or unexpected events that will cause them to miss an exam, students are required to notify the course instructor prior to the exam or as soon as is reasonably possible. Students that are physically unable (e.g. due to illness) to take the exam at the regularly scheduled time should not attempt to take the exam (once an examination is taken, its result is final). Makeup Exams should be taken no later than three business days after being able to return to classwork; students that do not take the exam within a reasonable time frame may receive a zero for the exam. Barring emergencies, only one makeup opportunity is granted for each exam. Midterm Exam makeups will be computer-based exams taken in the Pollock Testing Center and must be scheduled with the course administrator. Students are not to self-enroll in an exam at the Pollock Testing Center.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div><strong>Laboratory and Recitation</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The laboratory and recitation components of this course are structured around collaborative learning. You must be present in laboratory or recitation to do these assignments. Up to three (3) activities (labs and/or recitations) may be made up for a student throughout the entire course for University-approved reasons. More than three absences from activities at their regular times will interfere excessively with student learning. In extreme circumstances in which a student has four or more absences to be made up, he or she must contact the course administrator directly to discuss the situation as soon as possible. If you are absent from a laboratory or recitation section with a valid excuse, as described under \"Valid Excuse Policy\", <strong>fill out the Makeup Request form in Canvas within one week of the absence</strong>.&nbsp; Your score for the missed activity will be recorded as a zero until the activity is made up. If you are absent without a valid excuse, a score of zero will be recorded for that assignment. If a student is more than ten minutes late to a recitation or lab, leaves before their group is done, or is gone for more than ten minutes during the activity they cannot receive any credit for that period and this is NOT a valid excuse to request a makeup; if you would be late due to a reason that is a University approved reason (e.g. illness), you may request a makeup activity. </span></div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Expert TA</strong></div>\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You must complete the Problem sets as scheduled. They are available early so no excuses are accepted. Even technical glitches are not valid excuses. Importantly, that means please don't try to submit at 11:58PM for an 11:59PM deadline, as occasionally internet connections may lag. As mentioned above there is a window available for partial credit of Expert TA assignments. Because problem sets are available at least a week before the due date and can be done in advance, <strong>NO excuses are allowed.</strong></span></div>\n</div>\n<strong></strong></div>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\"><span class=\"normalSpan\"><strong>Valid Excuse Policy</strong></span></div>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\">There are several valid reasons for missing course activities (labs &amp; recitations or exams). All other reasons are not valid (including travel):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Illness (please don't come to lab/recitation/exam if you are sick!)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Family emergencies, including a death in the immediate family, death of a close friend, sudden hospitalization of a close family member, and events of similar gravity</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">University-approved curricular and extra-curricular activities; to obtain a makeup, a student needs to obtain a letter (or a class absence form) from the unit or department sponsoring the activity. The letter must indicate the anticipated absence dates, and it must be emailed to the course administrator before the first absence.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Religious holidays (must be submitted in advance)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong><i>&nbsp;Missing a laboratory or recitation due to an examination in another course is not considered a valid excuse. Please schedule a makeup/conflict exam for your other course.</i></strong> </span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">You have one week from the absence to submit a makeup request (less time right before each makeup period); otherwise it may be denied, barring extenuating circumstance (e.g., no access to the Internet due to reason for absence, such as an extended hospitalization).&nbsp; </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">All sign ups must be submitted through the Makeup/Conflict Form (linked from the CANVAS home page under \"Request Forms\").&nbsp; Requests to make up or be excused due to reasons that are based on false claims is cheating and will be treated as described in the Academic Integrity Policy.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3 class=\"normalDiv\"><a id=\"closure\" name=\"closure\"></a>Campus Closure Policy:</h3>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\">Students can sign up for the University's emergency notification system <a class=\"inline_disabled\" href=\"https://psualert.psu.edu/psualert\" target=\"_blank\">PSUAlert</a>. The University uses this system to announce campus closures (e.g. due to weather). Should the University Park campus be closed, this applies to all courses; announcements will be made in Canvas to describe how campus closures will affect PHYS 211 and will include information on how to proceed. Be sure to keep prevailing conditions in mind to safeguard your health and safety.</p>\n<p class=\"normalDiv\">In the event of a weather-related, or similar, campus closure, you will still be responsible for learning material that would otherwise be missed due to weather. Please do not email your instructors, we will post instructions on canvas. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"normalDiv\">If there is a 2 hour delay:\n<ul>\n<li class=\"normalDiv\">on a Monday or Friday, all lectures will be cancelled and an announcement will be made on how you will still be able to learn the missed material</li>\n<li class=\"normalDiv\">and your lab or recitation is cancelled, look to Canvas for instructions for make-up opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If class is cancelled for an entire day:\n<ul>\n<li>Again look to Canvas for instructions on how to proceed with learning the material from that day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<h3><a id=\"integrity\" name=\"integrity\"></a>Academic Integrity</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University\u2019s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students\u2019 dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Simply put, don't cheat, don't share your work, don't ask others to do work for you (online or in person) and don't plagiarize. If you think you are doing something wrong, you probably are. We take academic integrity very seriously. There are many ways to get help in this course and we hope you do contact any member of the instructional team if you feel unsure about the material and worry about your grade. Our goal is for you to learn the material and succeed in the course. Everyone can get an A and we are ready to help any students that struggle.&nbsp; Specifically, using online resources like Chat GTP, generative AI, or Chegg, UnstuckAI, etc to help you with classwork (especially during class) could be an academic integrity violation and could result in a negative impact to your grade. All labs, recitation, lecture notes, homework, are subject to copywrite and uploading/sharing this content without the university's consent is subject to copywrite violation laws as well.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">In exchange for your hard work, participation and academic integrity we promise to create the best learning environments that we can and to help you as much as we can. There will be many opportunities for help and we are fair to all students. Collaborations and discussions among the students are strongly encouraged (they help learning) but we expect your best efforts to individually learn the material and we expect honesty and academic integrity in all aspects of the course.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"#top\">return to top of page</a></div>\n<h3><a id=\"disability\" name=\"disability\"></a>Disability Policy</h3>\n<div class=\"normalDiv\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University's educational programs.

As a reminder, for your project, your task is to choose an event, video game, film, book, song, or other piece of media and analyze its apocalyptic geography in 2-3 pages. You will also deliver a verbal presentation of your project using a single slide during your recitation section later in the semester. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At this stage, we want you to consider the following questions as you brainstorm a topic and begin to connect the dots of your paper: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What kind of apocalypse(s) are you interested in?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Is there a particular event, story, video game, show, film, song, or other piece of media you would like to focus on for your project?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What do you think your choice of apocalypse story \u2018unveils\u2019 or reveals about ethics, institutions, and/or society?&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li data-leveltext=\"\uf0b7\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" data-list-defn-props=\"{&quot;335552541&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559991&quot;:360,&quot;469769226&quot;:&quot;Symbol&quot;,&quot;469769242&quot;:[8226],&quot;469777803&quot;:&quot;left&quot;,&quot;469777804&quot;:&quot;\uf0b7&quot;,&quot;469777815&quot;:&quot;hybridMultilevel&quot;}\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Given what you\u2019re learning about geographic concepts (e.g., scale, relation, space, place etc.), what is </span><strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">one </span></strong><span data-contrast=\"auto\">geographic idea&nbsp;that you think is relevant to your apocalypse of choice?
