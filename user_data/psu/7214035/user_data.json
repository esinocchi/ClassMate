Save such discussions for office hours with the course staff.</li>\n<li>Conceptual questions may be shared publicly but exercise sound judgment.</li>\n<li>If you are confident in your knowledge, it is acceptable to provide answers to your fellow students' questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Philosophy</span></h3>\n<p>System programming concerns the development of software and services used by applications and operating systems, e.g., OS functions, defragmenter, web servers, databases, search tools, backup systems, etc. This course will provide the information and experience required to understand, design, and implement components of large and small software systems.</p>\n<p>In general, students successfully completing the course will be able to evaluate design alternatives according to engineering best practices, specifications, performance analysis, robustness, etc. This course will investigate one system and one programming language in detail through demonstrations, programs, programming assignments, etc. The specific system is Unix, a family of operating systems forming a complete standardized programming environment based on the idea of software tools. The specific language is C, which is widely used for operating system implementations, and which forms the basis for the C++ and Java languages studied in the prerequisite courses. This will help students understand operating system services available to application programmers, and provide a firm ground for the study of operating systems in general.</p>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>This course covers the basic skills and topics that form the foundation of later CMPSC and CMPEN courses. For this reason, it is essential that every student attend and learn the material. It will be nearly impossible for students to complete later courses in these majors without mastery of this material.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Grading</span></h3>\n<p>The course will be graded on exams and course projects:</p>\n<table id=\"rounded-corner\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 49.4402%; height: 530px;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 34px;\">\n<th style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 34px;\">Activity</th>\n<th style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 34px;\">Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 28px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 28px;\">Course Projects</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 28px;\">50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #1</p>\n<p>Date: 17th February</p>\n<p>Time: 8:10 PM to 10:00 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Location:&nbsp;</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Forum Bldg 108 &amp; Keller Bldg 104</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 208px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 208px;\">\n<p>Midterm #2</p>\n<p>Date: 31st March</p>\n<p>Time: <span>&nbsp;8:10 PM - 10:00 PM</span></p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong><br>Section 001: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span><br>Section 002: <span>&nbsp;Thomas 100</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 208px;\">15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 52px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 96.1369%; height: 52px;\">Final Exam (time/date TBD)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 3.5461%; height: 52px;\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the exams to pass the class.</li>\n<li>You must receive at least 40% of the points for the class projects to pass the class.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Exam Policy: Make-Up and Conflict Exam</span></h3>\n<strong data-olk-copy-source=\"MessageBody\"></strong>Please note the following policy regarding exams for this course:</div>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<div>Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>There will be only one conflict/Makeup exam.<br>A conflict/Make-up exam will be offered only to students with a verified scheduling conflict and health issue.</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>To be eligible, students must provide appropriate documentation as proof of the conflict and other reasons.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div>Penalties for Missing the Conflict/Make-Up Exam:</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div>If you cannot attend the conflict/Make-Up exam, and request another conflict/Make-Up exam,&nbsp;<br>you will get a 25% penalty on points.

You must have completed and passed (C or better) the earlier courses CMPSC 131 and 132. If, instead, you have completed and passed similar courses elsewhere, contact the instructor. Prior experience with Unix or C is not expected, but you should be very familiar with the concepts introduced in CMPSC 131 and 132 and know how to use an integrated development environment, e.g., Microsoft's Visual Studio.</p>\n<p>If possible, you should take CMPEN 331, Computer Organization and Design, at the same time as this course, or within one semester of it. The connection between these courses would be stronger if we could require you to take both at the same time, but that's not possible. In 331, you learn about the basics of memory organization (registers, cache, main memory, virtual memory), instruction execution, exceptions and interrupts, and the translation of procedural programming languages into machine instructions.</p>\n<p>This is a three-credit course, and you can expect to spend a lot of time outside of class working on the project programming. To avoid turning the programming assignments into a nightmare of unsuccessful debugging, you should recognize symptoms of confusion early and promptly ask for help from the professors or TA. With the exception of first and second assignments, the following assignments will build on previous assignments, so incomplete or poor code will make later assignments very difficult if not impossible. For this reason, it is essential students do not get behind on the projects.</p>\n<p>We will often give you some code as examples or as a starter kit for an assignment, and the use of that material is encouraged. After that point, the programming work should be done on your own.<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>This will be strictly enforced.</strong></span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Course Ethics</span></h3>\n<p>This course considers topics involving systems. As part of this investigation, we will cover technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for any purpose or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class.</p>\n<p>Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating on tests, or other disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics and will result in the penalty identified above. Programming assignments must be completed without assistance or cooperation between students.</p>\n<p>Students are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries with it similar penalties.</p>\n<p>When in doubt, please contact the course professor for advice. Do not undertake any action which could be perceived as technology misuse or cheating anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received explicit permission from Professor Suman Saha.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Disability Accommodation</span></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University\u2019s educational programs.

The more specific purpose is to provide students a basic understanding of the role of financial and managerial accounting information in the decisions of capital market participants external to a business enterprise (e.g., stockholders, banks, financial analysts, prospective stockholders), and in the decisions of those who manage business enterprises. Accounting information has an important role in the resource allocation process in our socioeconomic system as a whole, as well as in each individual business enterprise. This course provides students with an understanding of the nature of the accounting function, and how the information in accounting reports is used by various decision-makers in their resource allocation decisions. This course is an important background course for all business majors and numerous non-business majors.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #394b58; background: #394b58; padding: 0 1rem;\">\n<h3 style=\"color: #fff; font-variant: small-caps;\"><strong> <img src=\"https://eldig.psu.edu/storyline/images/syl-faculty1.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\">Instructional Team</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex;\">\n<div class=\"grid-row\" style=\"grid-gap: 5%; margin: 0; width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/kms563-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Kristy Schenck</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:kms563@psu.edu\">kms563@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 200px; border: 5px solid #394b58;\" src=\"https://media.smeal.psu.edu/content_php/directory/photos/snh108-full.jpg\" alt=\"instructor photo\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Schalyn Sohn</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:snh108@psu.edu\">snh108@psu.edu</a></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img id=\"171435605\" src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682060/preview?verifier=YnFLamBH4JkZRJMKb86TtByip00tdgpqJ3WFKVCe\" alt=\"Curling.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682060\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Instructor:</span><br>Shelley Curling<br><a href=\"mailto:mlh257@psu.edu\">mlh257@psu.edu</a><br></strong></figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-xs\" style=\"padding: 0;\">\n<figure style=\"margin: 2rem;\"><img src=\"https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2364485/files/172682017/preview?verifier=FOXaFg0SSXguF2o2M0jFXC6ueLoELgEffGHPZYA0\" alt=\"instructor photo\" width=\"230\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" data-api-endpoint=\"https://psu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/2364485/files/172682017\" data-api-returntype=\"File\"><br>\n<figcaption style=\"margin-top: 1rem;\"><strong><span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">Course Coordinator:</span><br>Karen Trust<br></strong><a href=\"mailto:kjb322@psu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">kjb322@psu.edu</a>&nbsp;<br>Karen manages the TAs.

We will use a Freeware simulator called MARS to support the required assembly language programming. This software is available for download from the following link <a class=\"inline_disabled\" title=\"Link\" href=\"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">MARS</a> \"https://dpetersanderson.github.io\", MARS itself has a nice Help feature. \u201c<a href=\"http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/\">http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/</a>\u201d.</li>\n<li>For the Verilog language, you will need to use Xilinx Vivado/ModelSim. This is available in w136 Westgate building. You can also download Vivado (<strong>It is available for windows machine and it is not available for Mac</strong>). Instructions for downloading the Vivado WebPack version can be found here: \u201c <a href=\"https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html\">https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html</a><span>\u201d</span><span>.</span> Xilinx has a strict internal export control policy which blocks users from E or D category countries.

So, I request everyone to complete the installation as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>It is very recommended to install Vivado as all the labs hints are using this software. However, students facing the Vivado license issue should install an alternative software called \"Intel Quartus\".</li>\n<li>This is very uncommon but just to let you know that <strong>students who are outside the United States may face difficulties with respect to Vivado webpack installation due to license issues.</strong> <strong>They can install the Intel Quartus software instead</strong>.

However, you have the permission to miss one of the homework without penalty</u></strong>. You have to solve the online problems in the zyBooks website (https://www.zybooks.com). Some of the problems will be assigned in advance of covering their corresponding materials in class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Exams</u></em></p>\n<p>There will be <strong>three</strong> midterm exams. Each student is entitled to skip one exam due to official reasons without incurring any penalties. Consequently, no makeup exam will be granted for the first missed exam. You will only be eligible for a particular makeup exam if you have missed two or more exams due to official excuses. Please be aware that if you choose to miss one exam for personal reasons, it will count towards your official number of allowable excuses mentioned earlier. It is strongly recommended not to miss any exams unless you have an official excuse. Official excuses need to be approved by the instructor in advance. Please refer to the 'Guidelines for Makeup Examinations' for further information. <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup exam unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy.</strong></p>\n<p><em><u>&nbsp;</u></em></p>\n<p><em><u>Quizzes</u></em></p>\n<p>6 \u2013 9 pre-announced quizzes will be given during the semester, (<strong>no makeups,</strong> unless you have more than a defined number of official excuses), <strong>I will not respond to any email that requesting a makeup quiz unless it satisfies the aforementioned policy</strong>.&nbsp; Every student will have a defined number, in advance, of excuses to use them for skipping any defined number of quizzes if needed (these can be personal or official excuses). Meaning that, I will <strong>drop</strong> the lowest defined number of scores. This defined number is currently equal to two and it could increase in the future. You must take a permission <strong>in advance</strong> from the instructor if you would like to take your quiz with another section. Cheating on any QUIZ will result in 0 grade on that QUIZ.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><u>Labs</u></em></p>\n<p>Lab assignments will be assigned on canvas. Late submissions will incur a penalty of 2% per day, up to a maximum of 5 days (with one minute being equivalent to one day). It is advisable to adhere to timely submission and refrain from relying on the available late submission days. Your proactive approach to meeting deadlines is highly encouraged. No submission will be accepted after the 5<sup>th</sup> day of the due date. TAs or LAs (if any) will grade the submitted zipped file to canvas. Please expect that we might pick randomly some students to grade their submitted labs through one to one meeting with the grader. In this case, your answers have to match your submission and you need to show your understanding of your solution. Your GRADE will depend solely on your answers to the grader(s) questions in that particular lab. The same apply for the project stated in the next item.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em><u>Project</u></em></p>\n<p><strong>There will be one project. This project due date will be posted online, late submission will not be accepted.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><u>Guidelines for Makeup Examinations or Delayed Assignment Submission:</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>- A self-report or standard doctor's appointment is not considered an acceptable reason or suffice as an excuse.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- Evidence from an in-person visit with a healthcare practitioner, explicitly demonstrating the inability to partake in the exam/quiz as originally scheduled, is necessary.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- It must be emphasized that under these circumstances too, notifications regarding excuses have to be delivered at least 24 hours before the designated assignment due date. This is crucial as late submission requests beyond the assignment deadline or approved grace period will not be accommodated.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><strong>-An email petition sent by a student on the day of or one day prior to the exam requesting a makeup examination does not ensure automatic acceptance by the instructor. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Unexcused absence from an examination without prior consent of the instructor will disqualify students from being allowed a makeup opportunity regardless of their situation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING:</strong></p>\n<p>Homework: 5%</p>\n<p>Labs: 20%</p>\n<p>Quizzes: 25%</p>\n<p>Exam 1: 15% (Tentative: Week of February 24<sup>th </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 2: 15% (Tentative: Week of March 31<sup>st</sup> in class)</p>\n<p>Exam 3: 15% (Tentative: Week of April 21<sup>st </sup>in class)</p>\n<p>Project: 5 %</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>GRADING DISTRIBUTION: </strong></p>\n<p>A&nbsp; 100-94&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+&nbsp; &lt; 90 - 86&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C+&nbsp; &lt; 77 - 73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp; &lt; 68 - 61</p>\n<p>A-&nbsp; &lt;94- 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 86 - 81&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 73 - 68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 61 - 0</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 81-77&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>COURSE POLICIES</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Engaging in academic dishonesty during any examination will result in a grade of 0 for that specific examination. <strong>Violations will be subject to academic integrity consequences, which may include failure of the course in certain instances.

Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>According to Penn State policy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>, an academic integrity violation is \u201can intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.\u201d&nbsp;Unless your instructor tells you otherwise, you must complete all course work entirely on your own, using only sources that have been permitted by your instructor, and you may not assist other students with papers, quizzes, exams, or other assessments. If your instructor allows you to use&nbsp;ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person (e.g., from Course Hero or Chegg) or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, you must identify their source. You may not&nbsp;submit false or fabricated information, use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses, or share instructional content.&nbsp;Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor&nbsp;<strong>before submitting work</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course</strong>&nbsp;unless they are cleared of wrongdoing&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html\">G-9: Academic Integrity</a>). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean\u2019s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Appropriate behavior expectations </strong></p>\n<p><span>Sexual misconduct is never tolerated at Penn State. Prohibited conduct includes sexual and gender-based harassment, stalking, sexual assault, and dating violence. These behaviors are not allowed in the classroom, the campus community, labs, or anywhere students, staff, and faculty are located. Prohibited behaviors can include degrading comments such as belittling female-identified students, LGBTQ+ individuals, and gender-diverse students. It can also include harassment, touching someone without their consent, following someone without consent, repeated calls or messaging, physical acts of violence, and more. In other words, professional and appropriate behavior is always expected, and inappropriate or unprofessional behavior is never tolerated.

There will be 12 homework opportunities.  You will have unlimited attempts at each homework (i.e. you can do the HW  as many times as you wish before the deadline), and your highest homework score will be used in determining your final grade. </p>\n<p>A \"<strong>Check Answer</strong>\" button is available. Clicking this button will reveal if you have successfully completed the assignment question. <strong>You will have five attempts</strong> to check your answer when navigating each graded assignment question. After five attempts, if you want to earn a higher grade on that assignment you will have to restart the assignment. </p>\n<p>Each homework must be completed by the due date/time established in the Course Calendar.  Once a graded homework closes, <strong>it cannot be re-opened</strong> for any reason.  However, students can continue to review their submitted homework as part of their continued practice of the course material.</p>\n<p>If you want to keep practicing the homework assignment after the due date, please refer to the respective \"Study Attempts\" assignment. You do not earn points via the \"Study Attempts\" assignment, but it allows you to continue to practice the problems after the homework due date. </p>\n<p>To assist students with any technical issues, personal extenuating circumstances, or illness during a Lesson, we will drop the two lowest Homework scores earned.  Therefore, the 10 highest Homework scores will be used toward your final grade, and each assignment is worth 2%. </p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/account_10500000000085746/attachments/88254828/Mobile.js\"></script>",

What are the implications of these advancements and how could they benefit society? (This is an open-ended question that encourages discussion. It may require you to conduct research through various means such as the internet, library resources, and more to gather the necessary information and formulate your response).</p>\n<p>2-In our class discussion, we talked about the historical progression of computing systems. What about the environmental and social implications of the trajectory it\u2019s on. Additionally, think about some potential future developments that could come out of it and discuss an application that could be built which we don\u2019t yet see. Explain what the implications of that are in more detail.
